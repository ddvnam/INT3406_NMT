We talk about the results .
That was unthinkable .
I thought , that &apos;s the way it is .
That way of thinking got turned on its head when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science .
It &apos;s not by chance . It &apos;s a matter of values . &quot;
That &apos;s the beautiful thing about science .
And when you label something as objective and rational , automatically , the other side , the subjective and emotional , become labeled as non-science or anti-science or threatening to science , and we just don &apos;t talk about it .
And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference , I talked about my science , and then I talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them , and I looked at the audience , and they were cold .
And I tried again and again , conference after conference , but I wasn &apos;t getting through .
And eventually I managed to get out the cloud using improvisation and music .
We call it being scooped , and being scooped feels horrible .
I &apos;ve been scooped again Scoop ! Scoop ! And then we go for it .
Thank you for your backup singing .
It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted .
And scientists have gone on to form peer groups where they meet regularly and create a space to talk about the emotional and subjective things that happen as they &apos;re mentoring , as they &apos;re going into the unknown , and even started courses about the process of doing science , about going into the unknown together , and many other things .
And what I might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can &apos;t solve in work or in life , there &apos;s a word for what you &apos;re going to see : the cloud .
Thank you .
In 2002 , investigative journalist and TED Fellow Will Potter took a break from his regular beat , writing about shootings and murders for the Chicago Tribune . He went to help a local group campaigning against animal testing : &quot; I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive , &quot; he says . Instead , he was arrested , and so began his ongoing journey into a world in which peaceful protest is branded as terrorism .
I had done some activism in college , so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing .
Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
but I was terrified , and when my fear subsided , I became obsessed with finding out how this happened , how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI &apos;s number one domestic terrorism threat .
They &apos;re physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers &apos; harpoons and the whales .
And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular , so in 1985 , their opponents made up a new word , eco-terrorist , to shift how we view them . They just made it up .
Now most people never even heard about this law , including members of Congress .
The rest were outside at a new memorial .
Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists : the vandals , the arsonists , the radicals .
The FBI &apos;s training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence , they &apos;re about public relations .
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago , and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism .
And Amy did what any of us would : She filmed it .
But apparently , even exposing stuff like that is a threat .
They even included this nice little write-up of my book .
Blurb on the next book , right ?
Our best weapon is sunlight .
Over and over throughout history , people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent .
Thank you .
The beauty of hackers , says cybersecurity expert Keren Elazari , is that they force us to evolve and improve . Yes , some hackers are bad guys , but many are working to fight government corruption and advocate for our rights . By exposing vulnerabilities , they push the Internet to become stronger and healthier , wielding their power to create a better world .
His name was Barnaby Jack , and this technique was later called &quot; jackpotting &quot; in his honor .
Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge , but he chose to show the world his research instead .
And I feel the same way .
We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have .
But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all .
Sometimes they make us sick , but they also find those hidden threats in our world , and they make us fix it .
In true TED fashion , here is my most embarrassing picture .
I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn &apos;t let me join .
She portrayed Acid Burn in the &apos; 95 film &quot; Hackers . &quot;
And I wanted to be just like her , so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums .
I didn &apos;t really know what it did , but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that .
It was a simple trick , and I was just a script kiddie back then , but to me , that trick , it felt like this , like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips .
It &apos;s geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower , one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect , but thankfully no radioactive spiders .
But what if you could read your ex &apos;s emails , or add a couple zeros to your bank account .
Indeed , many hackers do not resist those temptations , and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud , malware or plain old identity theft , which is a serious issue .
This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office .
He reported it to the company , of course , but they ignored his report .
But they didn &apos;t steal anything .
Here &apos;s what you should do to fix it .
By getting into people &apos;s files like that , yeah , they broke the law , but they also forced that company to fix their product .
This is what Khalil did .
These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code .
Frustrated with the exchange , he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg &apos;s wall .
Thankfully for Khalil , a group of hackers were watching out for him .
But I think there &apos;s a greater story here still .
And so for more conservative organizations , it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it .
These are things that will come back and bite you .
I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition , its last line of defense even , perhaps someone like Anonymous , the leading brand of global hacktivism .
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites .
It turns out , the Internet doesn &apos;t like it when you try to remove things from it , and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world , from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide , Australia .
Since then , they &apos;ve gone after many targets .
They &apos;ve hacked popes and politicians , and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents .
It &apos;s not your documents . It &apos;s your attention .
They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists , and I cannot justify their illegal means , but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all .
They can bring people together .
This took place in Egypt in January 2011 , and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo , he sent his personal troops down to Egypt &apos;s Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country &apos;s connection to the world overnight .
Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground , helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio .
They found European service providers that still had 20-year-old analog dial-up access infrastructure .
It worked so well , in fact , one guy even used it to download an episode of &quot; How I Met Your Mother . &quot;
But with this sort of power , it really depends on where you stand , because one man &apos;s hero can be another &apos;s villain , and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime .
This tweet was fake , of course , but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not , and a lot of people lost a lot of money .
In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America , from Europe to the United States , hackers are a force for social , political and military influence .
They come from all walks of life , ethnicities , ideologies and genders , I might add .
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century .
And so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers , because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large .
He &apos;s the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander , but instead of his four star general uniform , he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt .
Perhaps like me , General Alexander didn &apos;t see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas .
In fact , he was there to give a hiring pitch .
Well , hackers in the back row replied , &quot; Then stop arresting us . &quot;
The rules of the game are not that clear anymore , but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates on their own playing field .
For the past three decades , hackers have done a lot of things , but they have also impacted civil liberties , innovation and Internet freedom , so I think it &apos;s time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them , because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys , how can they be the heroes too ?
They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it , and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world .
Thank you very much .
Robert Full : The secrets of nature &apos;s grossest creatures , channeled into robots
Even nature &apos;s most disgusting creatures have important secrets , but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them ?
we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs They can go over complex terrain like grass , no problem , and not get destabilized .
Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure . Here &apos;s a new behavior we &apos;ve discovered .
They can run upside down very rapidly on rods , branches and wires , and if you perturb one of those branches , they can do this .
And they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas .
This is the foot of a cockroach .
They can run up mesh without their feet .
Here &apos;s one moving with two middle legs gone .
And I point out that all of these videos are slowed down 20 times , so they &apos;re actually really fast , when you see this .
Here &apos;s an animal climbing up a wall .
Here &apos;s what they do .
extraordinary exoskeletons .
Here &apos;s a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach .
you laser cut it , laminate it , and you fold it up into a robot .
These robots , called DASH , for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod , are highly compliant robots , and they &apos;re remarkably robust as a result They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches .
They even have some of the beginnings where they disappear .
We discovered that they can go through three-millimeter gaps , the height of two pennies , two stacked pennies , and when they do this , they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds , although you never see it .
We put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces 800 times their body weight , and after this they can fly and run So you never know where curiosity-based research will lead , and someday you may want a swarm Thank you .
&quot; Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they &apos;re finished . &quot; Dan Gilbert shares recent research on a phenomenon he calls the &quot; end of history illusion , &quot; where we somehow imagine that the person we are right now is the person we &apos;ll be for the rest of time . Hint : that &apos;s not the case .
So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get .
Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain .
The question is , as a psychologist , that fascinates me is , why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret ?
Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan , that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year .
Is it teenage years ? Is it middle age ?
What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion , an illusion that history , our personal history , has just come to an end , that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives .
So here &apos;s a study of change in people &apos;s personal values over time .
Everybody here holds all of them , but you probably know that as you grow , as you age , the balance of these values shifts .
Well , we asked thousands of people .
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis , because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people , say , 18 years old , to the reports of people who were 28 , and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan .
First of all , you are right , change does slow down as we age , but second , you &apos;re wrong , because it doesn &apos;t slow nearly as much as we think .
We call this the &quot; end of history &quot; illusion .
Now it &apos;s not just values . It &apos;s all sorts of other things .
Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality : neuroticism , openness to experience , agreeableness , extraversion , and conscientiousness .
And it isn &apos;t just ephemeral things like values and personality .
For example , name your best friend , your favorite kind of vacation , what &apos;s your favorite hobby , what &apos;s your favorite kind of music .
We ask half of them to tell us , &quot; Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years ? &quot;
And what we find , well , you &apos;ve seen it twice now , and here it is again : people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they &apos;ll have in 10 years , the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they &apos;ll enjoy in 10 years , and yet , people who are 10 years older all say , &quot; Eh , you know , that &apos;s really changed . &quot;
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn &apos;t have consequences ?
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
And yet , when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today , they say only 80 dollars .
Why does this happen ? We &apos;re not entirely sure , but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining .
Sorry , when people say &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; they &apos;re usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they &apos;re describing .
It transforms our preferences .
It alters our personalities .
Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade .
It &apos;s a watershed on the timeline .
Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they &apos;re finished .
The one constant in our life is change .
Kitra Cahana : A glimpse of life on the road
As a little girl , I always imagined I would one day run away .
There was a deep restlessness in me , a primal fear that I would fall prey to a life of routine and boredom .
Years have passed , but many of the adventures I fantasized about as a child -- traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own — have become realities through my work as a documentary photographer .
This is the nomadic dream , a different kind of American dream lived by young hobos , travelers , hitchhikers , vagrants and tramps .
The word &quot; hobo &quot; conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal , legs dangling out of a boxcar , but these photographs are in color , and they portray a community swirling across the country , fiercely alive and creatively free , seeing sides of America that no one else gets to see .
By day , they hop freight trains , stick out their thumbs , and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms .
Some travelers take to the road by choice , renouncing materialism , traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange for a glimmer of adventure .
Where others see stories of privation and economic failure , travelers view their own existence through the prism of liberation and freedom .
They take advantage of the fact that in the United States , up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage by scavenging for perfectly good produce in dumpsters and trash cans .
But there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic .
Addiction is real , the elements are real , freight trains maim and kill , and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence .
I know about these laws because I &apos;ve watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so-called crimes .
The answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road , but travelers often respond with a single word : freedom .
Thank you .
Writer Andrew Solomon has spent his career telling stories of the hardships of others . Now he turns inward , bringing us into a childhood of adversity , while also spinning tales of the courageous people he &apos;s met in the years since . In a moving , heartfelt and at times downright funny talk , Solomon gives a powerful call to action to forge meaning from our biggest struggles .
And for a long time , I thought the meaning was out there , some great truth waiting to be found .
We call it finding meaning , but we might better call it forging meaning .
They &apos;re a gift because that &apos;s what we have chosen . &quot;
When I was in second grade , Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me .
And that day , my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae .
When I was in eighth grade , our science teacher told us that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter .
I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance .
After you &apos;ve forged meaning , you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity .
One of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book had been raped as an adolescent , and had a child following that rape , which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships .
And she said , &quot; I used to think about him with anger , but now only with pity . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Pity ? &quot;
So as it turns out , I &apos;m the lucky one . &quot;
And some are things that happen to us : being a political prisoner , being a rape victim , being a Katrina survivor .
It involves substituting &quot; and &quot; for &quot; but &quot; -- not &quot; I am here but I have cancer , &quot; but rather , &quot; I have cancer and I am here . &quot;
Forge meaning , build identity , forge meaning and build identity .
Forging meaning is about changing yourself .
All of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily : how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves , and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life ?
It only makes what was wrong precious .
Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses that landed them in prison , and they had walked in with their heads held high , and they walked out with their heads still held high , many years later .
She had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity .
Ma Thida said , &quot; We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure , but we also have grievance under glamour , &quot; she said , &quot; and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn &apos;t erase the continuing problems in our society that we learned to see so well while we were in prison . &quot;
I &apos;ve never been raped , and I &apos;ve never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison , but as a gay American , I &apos;ve experienced prejudice and even hatred , and I &apos;ve forged meaning and I &apos;ve built identity , which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse privation than I &apos;ve ever known .
I enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy , in which people I was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises with women I was encouraged to call surrogates , who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else .
These experiences eventually allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women , for which I &apos;m grateful , but I was at war with myself , and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche .
We cannot bear a pointless torment , but we can endure great pain if we believe that it &apos;s purposeful .
We could have been ourselves without our delights , but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning .
In 1988 , I went to Moscow to interview artists of the Soviet underground , and I expected their work to be dissident and political .
One of the artists I met said to me , &quot; We were in training to be not artists but angels . &quot;
And on the third day of the putsch , one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya .
If you get out of the way , we don &apos;t need to hurt you , but if you won &apos;t move , we &apos;ll have no choice but to run you down . &quot;
Give us just a minute to tell you why we &apos;re here . &quot;
And they went on and on , and the soldier watched , and then he sat there for a full minute and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain , and said , &quot; What you have said is true , and we must bow to the will of the people .
And that &apos;s what they did .
Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breeds the power to oppose it , and I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity .
The gay rights movement posits a world in which my aberrances are a victory .
Those are two totally separate enterprises , but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other .
People extol a difference only because it &apos;s theirs .
But properly understood and wisely practiced , identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human .
I would have had an easier life if I were straight , but I would not be me , and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else , someone who , to be honest , I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine .
I &apos;ve sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride &apos;s technicolor fiesta , of which this speech is one manifestation .
Someday , being gay will be a simple fact , free of party hats and blame , but not yet .
It &apos;s a great idea , but its time has not yet come .
In 29 states in the U.S. , I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay .
Twenty-seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy , and in Nigeria , gay people can legally be stoned to death , and lynchings have become common .
So who can forge meaning and build identity ?
I am lucky to have forged meaning and built identity , but that &apos;s still a rare privilege , and gay people deserve more collectively than the crumbs of justice .
In 2007 , six years after we met , my partner and I decided to get married .
Marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence .
I want my children to be happy , and I love them most achingly when they are sad .
A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me that Westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you and you have only bliss to look forward to .
Nirvana , he said , is what you arrive at when you have only bliss to look forward to and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy .
Perhaps I could .
But if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning , the question is not whether I &apos;d be happier for having been bullied , but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father .
I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families , but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh , and gay families so exhilaratingly new , and I found meaning in that surprise .
&quot; Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight . &quot;
And everyone turned around , startled .
I &apos;m glad we all get cake .
And I thought — Thank you .
The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement , and Harvey Milk said , &quot; Go out and tell someone . &quot;
If we live out loud , we can trounce the hatred and expand everyone &apos;s lives .
Forge meaning .
And then invite the world to share your joy .
Thank you . Thank you .
What makes a great leader ? Management theorist Simon Sinek suggests , it &apos;s someone who makes their employees feel secure , who draws staffers into a circle of trust . But creating trust and safety — especially in an uneven economy — means taking on big responsibility .
On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck . They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
We have it backwards . Right ?
And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why would you do it ?
And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
So trust and cooperation are really important here .
I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; Trust me , &quot; and you will .
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
Bad system of survival .
The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
I said , &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
And this is exactly what she said to me .
is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
It &apos;s the complete opposite . This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
None at all .
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
And Bob refused .
Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; Why would you do that ? Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Rives : The Museum of Four in the Morning
The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do : without me , and not online .
One hundred years later , exactly , actually , December 10 , 1996 , this charming lady , Wislawa Szymborska , won the Nobel Prize for literature .
She &apos;s a big deal , obviously , but back in &apos; 96 , I thought I had never heard of her , and when I checked out her work , I found this sweet little poem , &quot; Four in the Morning . &quot;
The hour from side to side .
And it goes on , but as soon as I read this poem , I fell for it hard , so hard , I suspected we must have met somewhere before .
Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere ?
Groucho Marx : Charlie , you should have come to the first party .
Rives : My roommates would have the TV on , and this would happen .
Rives : I would be listening to music , and this would happen .
Obviously , the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me .
I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually , and I never talked about it with anybody , but it did not , and I totally did .
So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples , but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year .
I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton .
However , had Matt been there , he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble .
That &apos;s how we did it in the pre-TED.com days .
When I got home , though , the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live , beginning with , and this is still my favorite , &quot; Here &apos;s another one for your collection : &apos; It &apos;s the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter . &apos; &quot; The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich .
Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something , and I &apos;m thinking , this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading , and I have infected him .
As a bonus , she hooked me up with a second one they make .
I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap .
&quot; It &apos;s 4 a.m. — maybe you &apos;d sleep better if you bought some crap . &quot;
More than one person sent me this .
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding ?
Rives : And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic .
Roy : No , it &apos;s not an accident . You wanted to get out of the house anyway , right ?
Rives : So that &apos;s &quot; Close Encounters , &quot; and the main character is all worked up because aliens , momentously , have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning , which does make that a very solid example .
They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem .
Right ? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur .
Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something .
TED.com launched , later that year , with a bunch of videos from past talks , including mine , and I started receiving &quot; four in the morning &quot; citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet .
I don &apos;t know anybody with juvenile diabetes .
I do not subscribe to Crochet Today ! magazine , although it looks delightful . Take note of those clock ends .
People sent me magazine ads .
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics .
There &apos;s a very cute example here from &quot; Calvin and Hobbes . &quot;
Take a look .
Fred Flintstone : Like at 4 a.m. , that &apos;s how early .
A thousand years from now , people are still doing this .
Rives : It shows the spectrum .
If I just stick to modern male movie stars , I keep it to the length of about a commercial .
Rives : So somewhere along the line , I realized I have a hobby I didn &apos;t know I wanted , and it is crowdsourced .
First of all , you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon .
You know , I was kind of interested .
Literature probably shows it best .
There &apos;s a five in the morning .
In &quot; Measure for Measure , &quot; it &apos;s the call time for the executioner .
Charlotte Brontë &apos;s &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning , as does Emily Brontë &apos;s &quot; Wuthering Heights . &quot;
&quot; Huckleberry Finn &quot; has one in dialect .
Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison &apos;s &quot; Invisible Man . &quot;
First paragraph , the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach , but we already know , cockroach notwithstanding , something is up with this guy .
What kind of person would do that ?
Newcaster : Top of the hour . Time for the morning news .
Everyone &apos;s still asleep in their comfy , comfy beds .
So that &apos;s Lucy from the Peanuts , &quot; Mommie Dearest &quot; , Rocky , first day of training , Nelson Mandela , first day in office , and Bart Simpson , which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category , people waking up , in my big old database .
Even if you don &apos;t really , at a certain point , you totally collect stuffed polar bears , and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass .
I got my curator on . I started fact checking , downloading , illegally screen-grabbing .
My hobby had become a habit , and my habit gave me possibly the world &apos;s most eclectic Netflix queue .
Why &quot; Porn Star : Legend of Ron Jeremy &quot; ?
Ron Jeremy : I was born in Flushing , Queens on March , 12 , 1953 , at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence , &quot; I was born at four o &apos;clock in the morning , &quot; which I had because someone else had emailed it to me , and when they did , I had another bump up in my entry for this , because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people .
So last October , in gentleman scholar tradition , I put the entire collection online as &quot; Museum of Four in the Morning . &quot;
It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection .
Billy Collins : No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
Rives : So the first hour of this project was satisfying .
Half a globe away , a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me , a stranger .
I received a poignant tweet .
It just said , &quot; Reminds me of an ancient mix tape . &quot;
As soon as I saw the initials , and the profile pic , I knew immediately , my whole body knew immediately who this was , and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about .
This is in the early &apos; 90s . I was an undegrad .
Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off , lets her hair down , suddenly she &apos;s smoking hot .
But her mix tape did not get away .
It &apos;s the kind of box where , if I have a girlfriend , I tend to hide it from her , and if I had a wife , I &apos;m sure I would share it with her , but the story — — with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side , but no song titles .
When I got this mix tape , I put it in my cassette player , I took it to the campus library , her library , I found 14 books on the shelves .
I did this again last October .
And then I thought , &quot; Good for him . &quot;

Tristram Wyatt : The smelly mystery of the human pheromone
&quot; Pheromone &quot; is a very powerful word .
But it &apos;s only 50 years old . It was invented in 1959 .
Now , this is a very attractive idea , and the molecules they mention sound really science-y .
It &apos;s things like androstenol , androstenone or androstadienone .
But sadly , these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science .
We &apos;re mammals . We produce a lot of smell .
They &apos;ve just plucked a few , and all these experiments are based on those , but there &apos;s no good evidence at all .
It is , and some people are real enthusiasts , and one of these was Napoleon .
So he didn &apos;t want to lose any of her richness in the days before he &apos;d get home , and it is still , you &apos;ll find websites that offer this as a major quirk .
So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are , tell you why I think we would expect humans to have pheromones , tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones , and then finally , I want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going .
A female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around , and it wasn &apos;t a sound , it was a smell .
But the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn &apos;t identify the molecules .
The reason for that , of course , is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities , and in the case of the dog , males dogs can smell it , but we can &apos;t smell it .
Now , this was an inspired choice by Adolf Butenandt and his team , because he needed half a million moths to get enough material to do the chemical analysis .
He basically went through systematically , showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males , not all the others .
He synthesized the molecule , and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was , indeed , that molecule .
That &apos;s the thing which has never been done with humans : nothing systematic , no real demonstration .
It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters .
So we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom .
Well , the first thing , of course , is that we &apos;re mammals , and mammals are smelly .
But the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we grow up .
What &apos;s changed ? And of course , it &apos;s puberty .
If we were any other kind of mammal , or any other kind of animal , we would say , &quot; That must be something to do with pheromones , &quot; and we &apos;d start looking properly .
There are , indeed , problems .
It &apos;s all about culture .
And I understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo , because it &apos;s always something nice to smell .
Now , the cheese behind me is a British , if not an English , delicacy .
Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries .
If you were to come from Iceland , your national dish is deep rotted shark .
You &apos;re part of the in-group .
Each of us has a unique odor world , in the sense that what we smell , we each smell a completely different world .
It &apos;s really hard , but in essence , nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors , and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors , and if they bond , they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain .
If you &apos;re a human , you have about 400 different kinds of receptors , and the brain knows what you &apos;re smelling because of the combination of receptors and nerve cells that they trigger , sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion .
So we each have an individual world of smell , and that complicates anything when we &apos;re studying smell .
Now , I &apos;m not going to share them with you , but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones .
The other primates have scent glands in other parts of the body .
When they &apos;re secreted from the glands , the molecules are odorless .
And so incidentally , if you want to reduce the amount of smell , clear-cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria , and you &apos;ll find they remain less smelly for much longer .
There is actually another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there , and that &apos;s because 20 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have smelly armpits like me .
They simply don &apos;t secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits .
So what should we be doing in our search for human pheromones ?
We &apos;re mammals , like everybody else who &apos;s a mammal , and we probably do have them .
No matter how embarrassing , we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread .
We also need to go back to the ideas that Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth .
It isn &apos;t good enough simply to pluck a couple and say , &quot; They &apos;ll do . &quot;
There is one team that I &apos;m actually very impressed by .
They &apos;ve turned their attention now to human babies and mothers .
Her nipple is completely hidden by the baby &apos;s head , but what you &apos;ll notice is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it , and that &apos;s the secretion from the areolar glands .
It &apos;s a very interesting secretion .
So this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we &apos;ve put a clean glass rod .
But if we go to any mother who is secreting from the areolar glands , it can be from any mother , if we take the secretion and now put it under the baby &apos;s nose , we get a very different reaction .
Now , since this is from any mother , it could really be a pheromone .
Any mother will do .
It &apos;s because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have , and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle and the number of areolar glands she has .
If you &apos;re a mammal , the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth .
You &apos;ll be dead .
So what I want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic , really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones .
There could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don &apos;t know at the moment .
They &apos;re about all sorts of things to do with a mammal &apos;s life .
There &apos;s lots to find .
Randall Munroe : Comics that ask &quot; what if ? &quot;
So , I have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer , and I try to answer them using math , science and comics .
So I did some calculations .
The ball would smash right into and through them , and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen , carbon and hydrogen from the ball , fragmenting it off into tiny particles , and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it .
Now at this point , about 30 nanoseconds in , the home plate is far enough away that light hasn &apos;t had time to reach it , which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong .
So if you were watching this whole thing from a hill , ideally , far away , what you &apos;d see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds , followed by a blast wave spreading out , shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium , and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city . So the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy , but — — under rule 6.02 and 5.09 , I think that in this situation , the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base , if it still existed .
I &apos;ve had someone write and say , scientifically speaking , what is the best and fastest way to hide a body ?
And I had someone write in , I &apos;ve had people write in about , can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart &apos;s broken ?
But one week , a couple months ago , I got a question that was actually about Google .
Now , Google &apos;s pretty secretive about their operations , so no one really knows how much data Google has , and in fact , no one really knows how many data centers Google has , except people at Google itself .
So I decided to try to figure this out myself .
I started with money .
And you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up , which turns out , it &apos;s pretty sizable .
So they go through a huge number of them .
You can also look at power .
You can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know , how big are they ?
How many server racks could you fit in there ?
You know how much they spent , and they also , say , because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided , you might know what they made a deal to buy , so you know how much power it takes .
And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities , you know , with guesses about the total amount of storage , the number of servers , the number of drives per server , and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don &apos;t know .
And this is a lot of fun .
So what I did , I went through all of this information , spent a day or two researching .
You could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post .
Sometimes , when people visit a data center , they &apos;ll take a cell-cam photo and post it , and they aren &apos;t supposed to , but you can learn things about their hardware that way .
Turns out , they know where all the Google data centers are , at least the ones that have people in them .
So I came up with this estimate , and this is a staggering amount of data .
There &apos;s a couple of other contenders , especially everyone always thinks of the NSA .
Adding all of this up , I came up with the other thing that we can answer , which is , how many punch cards would this take ?
So this is impractical , but I think that &apos;s about the best answer I could come up with .
And I didn &apos;t expect to get an answer from Google , because of course they &apos;ve been so secretive , they didn &apos;t answer of my questions , and so I just put it up and said , well , I guess we &apos;ll never know .
So I go and get it , open it up , and it &apos;s punch cards . Google-branded punch cards .
So I get some software and start reading it , and scan them , and it turns out it &apos;s a puzzle .
And I love calculating these kinds of things , and it &apos;s not that I love doing the math .
What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know , and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper , find out something that you didn &apos;t know that &apos;s very surprising .
And sometimes not .
Urgent . And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer .
Stanley McChrystal : The military case for sharing knowledge
When I was a young officer , they told me to follow my instincts , to go with my gut , and what I &apos;ve learned is that often our instincts are wrong .
It shocked the world , it shook up the American government , and it made people ask a lot of questions , because the sheer amount of information that was let out , and the potential impacts , were significant .
Why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person ?
Our main effort was inside Iraq , and our specified mission was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq .
We did everything we could to stop al Qaeda and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as accelerants to the violence .
We bled , we died , and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the Iraqi people .
It was security . It was protecting information .
And we had a sense that , as we operated within our organizations , it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations , particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know .
Who needed , who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed ?
It &apos;s very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn &apos;t .
But what we found is we had to change .
We had to knock down walls . We had to share .
It was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its DNA .
We captured the personnel records for the people who were bringing foreign fighters into Iraq .
But as I was talking to my intelligence officer , I said , &quot; What do we do ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , can we declassify them ?
And he says , &quot; They &apos;re their personnel records . &quot;
The fact that I know something has zero value if I &apos;m not the person who can actually make something better because of it .
It was the fundamental shift , not new tactics , not new weapons , not new anything else .
And I want everybody to take a deep breath and let it out , because in your life , there &apos;s going to be information that leaks out you &apos;re not going to like .
Thank you .
I just wonder , do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty ?
We , most people , don &apos;t know all the facts .
Edward Snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand .
HW : Thank you so much . Thank you .
Marco Tempest uses charming stagecraft to demo EDI , the multi-purpose robot designed to work very closely with humans . Less a magic trick than an intricately choreographed performance , Tempest shows off the robot &apos;s sensing technology , safety features and strength , and makes the case for a closer human-robot relationship .
Say hello to EDI .
EDI , EDI .
Audiences marveled at the way they moved .
EDI : Robot . A word coined in 1921 in a science fiction tale by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek .
It means &quot; forced labor . &quot;
They were not intelligent .
EDI is different .
EDI : I am 176 centimeters tall .
EDI : I have two seven-axis arms — MT : Core of sensing — EDI : A 360-degree sonar detection system , and come complete with a warranty .
EDI : Hi . I &apos;m EDI . Will you be my friend ?
We build them so they look like us , behave like us , and think like us .
In the first story about robots , they turn against their creators .
EDI : Ha ha ha . Now you are the slaves and we robots , the masters .
When someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
Now , this goes both ways .
MT : Robots cannot anticipate human actions .
I literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next , you know , but it scares me .
Accidents are inevitable .
MT : Sorry . Now , one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
With that in mind , I set about teaching EDI a magic trick .
Abracadabra .
EDI : Yeah . It &apos;s all part of the illusion , Marco .
MT : Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality .
Alan Turing , a pioneer of artificial intelligence , spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think .
MT : In other words , if we do not yet have the technological solutions , would illusions serve the same purpose ?
EDI : A robot may not harm humanity , or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm .
MT : We anthropomorphize our machines .
EDI : I am EDI .
MT : We let them entertain us .
EDI : Marco , you &apos;re standing on my foot !
And now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
EDI : Thank you !
Mellody Hobson : Color blind or color brave ?
So it &apos;s 2006 .
He &apos;s running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee , and he says , &quot; Mellody , I desperately need some national press . Do you have any ideas ? &quot;
You come with him . &quot;
We are in our best suits .
And we get to the receptionist , and we say , &quot; We &apos;re here for the lunch . &quot;
We walk through a series of corridors , and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a stark room , at which point she looks at us and she says , &quot; Where are your uniforms ? &quot;
The blood drains from her face .
And I look at her , and I say , &quot; Now , don &apos;t you think we need more than one black person in the U.S. Senate ? &quot;
And I wasn &apos;t surprised because of something my mother taught me about 30 years before .
I remember one day coming home from a birthday party where I was the only black kid invited , and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions like , &quot; Did you have fun ? &quot; or &quot; How was the cake ? &quot;
I was seven . I did not understand .
But she knew .
Now , race is one of those topics in America that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable .
There is shock , followed by a long silence .
And I have to tell you , I actually for a moment was a bit afraid .
And so I decided to actually talk about race .
Now I know there are people out there who will say that the election of Barack Obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity , right ?
And here , there are significant , quantifiable racial disparities that cannot be ignored , in household wealth , household income , job opportunities , healthcare .
Of the Fortune 250 , there are only seven CEOs that are minorities , and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today , thousands , only two are chaired by black women , and you &apos;re looking at one of them , the same one who , not too long ago , was nearly mistaken for kitchen help .
Now I have this thought experiment that I play with myself , when I say , imagine if I walked you into a room and it was of a major corporation , like ExxonMobil , and every single person around the boardroom were black , you would think that were weird .
And I know how we got here .
You know , there was institutionalized , at one time legalized , discrimination in our country .
But still , as I grapple with this issue , my mother &apos;s question hangs in the air for me : How did they treat you ?
I have succeeded in my life beyond my wildest expectations , and I have been treated well by people of all races more often than I have not .
I cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real , and I stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination because I believe it threatens to rob another generation of all the opportunities that all of us want for all of our children , no matter what their color or where they come from .
You see , researchers have coined this term &quot; color blindness &quot; to describe a learned behavior where we pretend that we don &apos;t notice race .
Now , color blindness , in my view , doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no racial discrimination , and there &apos;s fairness .
In my view , color blindness is very dangerous because it means we &apos;re ignoring the problem .
They actually recognize that embracing diversity means recognizing all races , including the majority one .
In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes , the one that black people don &apos;t like to swim , I &apos;m going to tell you how much I love to swim .
And one day my coach had me do a drill where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool without taking a breath .
And I failed a lot .
And my coach looked me at me , and he said , &quot; Mellody , that was not a breath-holding exercise .
If we can learn to deal with our discomfort , and just relax into it , we &apos;ll have a better life .
We cannot afford to be color blind .
We have to be willing , as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists , we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race with honesty and understanding and courage , not because it &apos;s the right thing to do , but because it &apos;s the smart thing to do , because our businesses and our products and our science , our research , all of that will be better with greater diversity .
He runs ESPN .
He joined ESPN , which already had a culture of inclusion and diversity , but he took it up a notch .
Now he says the senior people in the beginning bristled , and they would come to him and say , &quot; Do you want me to hire the minority , or do you want me to hire the best person for the job ? &quot;
And by saying yes to diversity , I honestly believe that ESPN is the most valuable cable franchise in the world .
Now I can tell you , in my own industry , at Ariel Investments , we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage , and that advantage can extend way beyond business .
He is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity .
The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic .
And the beginnings of the cure to the disease came from the most unlikely source , a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids were not getting smallpox .
Now I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sitting here and you &apos;re saying , I don &apos;t run a cable company , I don &apos;t run an investment firm , I am not a dairy farmer .
And I &apos;m telling you , you can be color brave .
If you are trying to solve a really hard problem , you can speak up and be color brave .
I &apos;m asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally .
You might get powerful new insights from these individuals , or , like my husband , who happens to be white , you might learn that black people , men , women , children , we use body lotion every single day .
Now , I told you , my mother , she was ruthlessly realistic .
She was the kind of person who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in Chicago .
And that meant sometimes we got our phone disconnected , or our lights turned off , or we got evicted .
But she never gave up hope , ever , and she never allowed us to give up hope either .
She taught me so many lessons , but the most important lesson was that every single day she told me , &quot; Mellody , you can be anything . &quot;
And it &apos;s because of those words that I stand here right now full of passion , asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today .
And I want them to know that anything is possible , that they can achieve the highest level that they ever imagined , that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom , or they can lead any company .
America , when we have a challenge , we take it head on , we don &apos;t shrink away from it .
So right now , what I &apos;m asking you to do , I &apos;m asking you to show courage .
As business leaders , I &apos;m asking you not to leave anything on the table .
I &apos;m asking you not to be color blind , but to be color brave , so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible .
Thank you . Thanks . Thanks .
Thirty-nine million people in the world are blind , and the majority lost their sight due to curable and preventable diseases . But how do you test and treat people who live in remote areas , where expensive , bulky eye equipment is hard to come by ? TED Fellow Andrew Bastawrous demos a smartphone app and cheap hardware that might help .
Eighty percent of them are living in low-income countries such as Kenya , and the absolute majority do not need to be blind .
Knowing this , with my young family , we moved to Kenya .
The challenges were great .
Power was rarely available .
And then something occurred to me : There has to be an easier way , because it &apos;s the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it .
So we said , could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way ?
We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment , which is bulky , expensive and fragile , with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age .
We &apos;ve got many trials going on in the community and in schools , and through the lessons that we &apos;ve learned in the field , we &apos;ve realized it &apos;s extremely important to share the data in non-medical jargon so that people understand what we &apos;re examining and what that means to them .
Once we &apos;ve discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health .
And the beauty is , anybody can do it .
When we first moved to Kenya , we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment , a team of 15 people , and that was what was needed to deliver health care .
And it costs just 500 dollars .
Our healthcare workers travel with a solar-powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up .
We go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive , high-tech , accurate examination , which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training .
Project managers , hospital directors , are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in .
Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract .
We can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we &apos;re coming to arrange a treatment .
Those blue pins that drop represent elders , or local leaders , that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment . So for patients like Mama Wangari , who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren , for less than 40 dollars , we can restore her eyesight .
It &apos;s only in statistics that people go blind by the millions .
But now , they might just be a text message away from help .
So here we have the Peek Vision app .
We can see all parts of the retina .
But now we can . Thank you .
When you look at sporting achievements over the last decades , it seems like humans have gotten faster , better and stronger in nearly every way . Yet as David Epstein points out in this delightfully counter-intuitive talk , we might want to lay off the self-congratulation . Many factors are at play in shattering athletic records , and the development of our natural talents is just one of them .
Faster , Higher , Stronger .
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes .
Now we all have this feeling that we &apos;re somehow just getting better as a human race , inexorably progressing , but it &apos;s not like we &apos;ve evolved into a new species in a century .
I want to take a look at what &apos;s really behind this march of athletic progress .
Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the 100 meters , when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished , Owens would have still had 14 feet to go .
To give you a sense of how much it is , I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker .
And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race .
Bang ! The gun goes off .
Usain Bolt starts to catch him .
That &apos;s the entire finish of the race .
That first beep was Usain Bolt .
Listen to it again .
And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible .
Rather than blocks , Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from .
Rather than the last beep , Owens would have been the second beep .
That &apos;s the difference track surface technology has made , and it &apos;s done it throughout the running world .
In 1954 , Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile .
On rare occasions , a high school kid does it .
So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks , and their consensus that it &apos;s one and a half percent slower .
Only 530 are left .
Now , 530 is a lot more than one , and that &apos;s partly because there are many more people training today and they &apos;re training more intelligently .
And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon in three in a half hours , that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course .
Clearly , athletes have gotten more savvy about performance-enhancing drugs as well , and that &apos;s made a difference in some sports at some times , but technology has made a difference in all sports , from faster skis to lighter shoes .
The record is always trending downward , but it &apos;s punctuated by these steep cliffs .
Rather than stopping and turning around , athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction .
This final cliff , the introduction of full-body and low-friction swimsuits .
In 1972 , Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at 30 miles , 3,774 feet .
But then in 2000 , the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in 1972 .
30 miles , 4,657 feet , a grand total of 883 feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago .
Still , technology isn &apos;t the only thing pushing athletes forward .
In the early half of the 20th century , physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors : medium height , medium weight , no matter the sport .
In the 1920s , the average elite high-jumper and average elite shot-putter were the same exact size .
Today , rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper , the average elite shot-putter is two and a half inches taller and 130 pounds heavier .
In fact , if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th century , it looks like this .
Then that idea started to go away , and at the same time , digital technology -- first radio , then television and the Internet -- gave millions , or in some cases billions , of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance .
It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies .
The athletes &apos; bodies have gotten much more different from one another .
In sports where height is prized , like basketball , the tall athletes got taller .
Suddenly , anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be , and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships .
Today , one in 10 men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall , but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population -- so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who is at least seven feet tall , there &apos;s a 17 percent chance he &apos;s in the NBA right now .
And that &apos;s not the only way that NBA players &apos; bodies are unique .
My arm span is exactly equal to my height .
But not the average NBA player .
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall , they are ludicrously long .
So in sports where large size is prized , the large athletes have gotten larger .
The average elite female gymnast shrunk from 5 &apos; 3 &quot; to 4 &apos; 9 &quot; on average over the last 30 years , all the better for their power-to-weight ratio and for spinning in the air .
The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer , all the better for a forceful throwing whip .
In swimming , the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs .
And the opposite is advantageous in running .
And this shows in athletes &apos; bodies today .
These men are seven inches different in height , but because of the body types advantaged in their sports , they wear the same length pants .
Now in some cases , the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren &apos;t previously competing at all , like Kenyan distance runners .
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners .
And they happen , on average , to have a certain unique physiology : legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity , and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate , and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes .
To put Kalenjin running success in perspective , consider that 17 American men in history have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes in the marathon .
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October .
Still , even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don &apos;t account for all of the changes in performance .
Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they &apos;re thrown across a room ?
What &apos;s happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once , and they &apos;re throwing themselves across the room .
That &apos;s the power that &apos;s contained in the human body .
Our brain acts as a limiter , preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources , because we might hurt ourselves , tearing tendons or ligaments .
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example .
We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring , short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs , and when we run , we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight .
They have to run like this .
Have you ever looked at an ape &apos;s butt ?
And as athletes have realized that we &apos;re perfectly suited for ultra-endurance , they &apos;ve taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before , athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet .
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist .
He &apos;s pulling up on a rope .
Amazing .
Now that he has done this , other athletes will follow , just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile .
Innovation in sports , whether that &apos;s new track surfaces or new swimming techniques , the democratization of sport , the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world , and imagination in sport , an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of , have conspired to make athletes stronger , faster , bolder , and better than ever .
Wendy Chung : Autism — what we know
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Why did my child develop autism ? &quot;
But autism is not a single condition .
That same diagnosis of autism , though , also applies to Gabriel , another 13-year-old boy who has quite a different set of challenges .
He can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease , yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation , he has great difficulty .
He has difficulty starting a conversation , feels awkward , and when he gets nervous , he actually shuts down .
One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism .
Has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
And in fact , in the late 1980s , the early 1990s , legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources , with access to educational materials that would help them .
As a result of that , more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed .
The next question everyone wonders is , what caused autism ?
But let me be very clear : Vaccines do not cause autism .
It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet , in which it was published , and that author , a physician , had his medical license taken away from him .
Furthermore , one of the ingredients in vaccines , something called thimerosal , was thought to be what the cause of autism was .
So again , there is no evidence that this is the answer .
In fact , there &apos;s probably not one single answer .
Based on epidemiological data , we know that one of the causes , or one of the associations , I should say , is advanced paternal age , that is , increasing age of the father at the time of conception .
During that period , while the fetal brain is developing , we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism .
In addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism .
I &apos;m focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism , but it &apos;s a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene .
Males are affected four to one compared to females with autism , and we really don &apos;t understand what that cause is .
In other words , if one sibling has autism , what &apos;s the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism ?
And when you look at those concordance ratios , one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins , that concordance rate is 77 percent .
It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism , but yet they account for a lot of that risk , because when you look at fraternal twins , that concordance rate is only 31 percent .
So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic .
When we compare it to other conditions that we &apos;re familiar with , things like cancer , heart disease , diabetes , in fact , genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions .
It doesn &apos;t even tell us in any one child , is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes ?
That is , that it is one single , powerful , deterministic gene that causes the autism .
We don &apos;t know in any one person , necessarily , which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper .
And let me pose something that might not be intuitive .
And the reason is because in certain individuals , they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father , but actually start brand new in them , mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family .
So in fact , at the Simons Foundation , we took 2,600 individuals that had no family history of autism , and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases ?
In doing so , I apologize , I &apos;m going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia , but I &apos;m going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory , we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information .
We had to get more granular than that , though , and so we had to start opening those books , and in some cases , the genetic change was more subtle .
In doing this within these families , we were able to account for approximately 25 percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families .
As we did this , though , it was really quite humbling , because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism .
And that explains , in part , why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects .
It &apos;s not simply random 200 , 400 different genes , but in fact they fit together .
They fit together in a network that &apos;s starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions .
But early diagnosis is a key for us .
And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods to be able to take infants , small babies , and be able to use biomarkers , in this case eye contact and eye tracking , to identify an infant at risk .
This baby we know is going to be in the clear .
In this particular child , you can see , it &apos;s not making good eye contact .
How are we going to intervene ?
In part , in some individuals , we &apos;re going to try and use medications .
But that &apos;s not going to be the only answer .
Individuals with autism , some of them are wired a little bit differently .
They absorb their surroundings in a different way , and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best .
You could imagine , for instance , Gabriel , with his social awkwardness , might be able to wear Google Glass with an earpiece in his ear , and have a coach be able to help him , be able to help think about conversations , conversation-starters , being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date .
As much as we know , there is so much more that we don &apos;t know , and so I invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better , to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference , and in particular , for the individuals in families with autism , I invite you to join the interactive autism network , to be part of the solution to this , because it &apos;s going to take really a lot of us to think about what &apos;s important , what &apos;s going to be a meaningful difference .
Is it something that &apos;s really going to make a difference in your lives , as an individual , as a family with autism ?
So I invite all of you to join the mission and to help to be able to make the lives of individuals with autism so much better and so much richer .
Elizabeth Gilbert : Success , failure and the drive to keep creating
So , a few years ago I was at JFK Airport about to get on a flight , when I was approached by two women who I do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads .
You got something to do with that whole &apos; Eat , Pray , Love &apos; thing that &apos;s been going on lately ? &quot;
And she smacks her friend and she goes , &quot; See , I told you , I said , that &apos;s that girl .
So that &apos;s who I am .
But it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world I was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody , because I knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored &quot; Eat , Pray , Love &quot; were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it wasn &apos;t going to be &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; and all of those people who had hated &quot; Eat , Pray , Love &quot; were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it would provide evidence that I still lived .
But if I had done that , if I had given up writing , I would have lost my beloved vocation , so I knew that the task was that I had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome .
And I did , in the end , find that inspiration , but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place .
So just to back up and explain , the only thing I have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer .
After college , I got a job as a diner waitress , kept working , kept writing , kept trying really hard to get published , and failing at it .
So for almost six years , every single day , I had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox .
But then I would find my resolve , and always in the same way , by saying , &quot; I &apos;m not going to quit , I &apos;m going home . &quot;
For me , going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home , because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing , which is to say that I loved writing more than I loved my own ego , which is ultimately to say that I loved writing more than I loved myself .
But the weird thing is that 20 years later , during the crazy ride of &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; I found myself identifying all over again with that unpublished young diner waitress who I used to be , thinking about her constantly , and feeling like I was her again , which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives could not have been more different .
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation .
Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again ?
So think of it like this : For most of your life , you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular , but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment .
And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad , and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good , but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good .
And there &apos;s a real equal danger in both cases of getting lost out there in the hinterlands of the psyche .
So that might be creativity , it might be family , it might be invention , adventure , faith , service , it might be raising corgis , I don &apos;t know , your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential .
So after the weird , disorienting success that I went through with &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; I realized that all I had to do was exactly the same thing that I used to have to do all the time when I was an equally disoriented failure .
And you know what happened with that book ?
Actually , I kind of felt bulletproof , because I knew that I had broken the spell and I had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it .
My point is that I &apos;m writing another one now , and I &apos;ll write another book after that and many of them will fail , and some of them might succeed , but I will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as I never forget where I rightfully live .
Something worthy , by the way , so addiction and infatuation don &apos;t count , because we all know that those are not safe places to live . Right ?
And if you should someday , somehow get vaulted out of your home by either great failure or great success , then your job is to fight your way back to that home the only way that it has ever been done , by putting your head down and performing with diligence and devotion and respect and reverence whatever the task is that love is calling forth from you next .
Thank you .
&quot; The computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression , &quot; says designer and TED Fellow James Patten . But right now , we interact with computers , mainly , by typing and tapping . In this nifty talk and demo , Patten imagines a more visceral , physical way to bring your thoughts and ideas to life in the digital world , taking the computer interface off the screen and putting it into your hands .
And I &apos;d like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world A few years ago , I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York , I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays .
There are two pairs of shoes , a man &apos;s pair and a woman &apos;s pair , and they play out this slow , tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space , and then she moves away .
My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork &apos;s Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music .
And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit , and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on .
And when you think about it , this makes a lot of sense , that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily .
Think about which you find easier to use , a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone ?
I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time .
But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over 10,000 dollars .
So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface .
So here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
So if we want to tweak the color , we just enter the color mode , and then we get three different dials or if we want to adjust the audio , then we get two different dials for that , these physical objects .
So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that &apos;s designed in software .
So you have these physical objects that represent police , fire and rescue , and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go , and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world .
It &apos;s amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object .
But one of the areas that I &apos;m most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone .
So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein , and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways .
So feeling what &apos;s going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction .
Maybe this is the computer of the future .
There &apos;s no technology visible at all .
Thank you .
Hamish Jolly , an ocean swimmer in Australia , wanted a wetsuit that would deter a curious shark from mistaking him for a potential source of nourishment . Working with a team of scientists , he and his friends came up with a fresh approach — not a shark cage , not a suit of chain-mail , but a sleek suit that taps our growing understanding of shark vision .
Science starts with observation , but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss isolate them , and test them with scientific rigor .
Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years , unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period But Western Australia is not alone in this .
And so it &apos;s not surprising , perhaps , that in July of this year , Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see .
we were looking , it was about three years ago , and we &apos;d just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia , and by chance , in a previous role , I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler .
Harry Butler is a precursor , if you like , to the late Steve Irwin .
He said , &quot; Take a black wetsuit , band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee , and you &apos;ll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species . &quot;
And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues .
So biologically , there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns , warning patterns , to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked , not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage , particularly for attack , but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target , and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack .
But isn &apos;t human anecdote also an evolution of sorts , the idea that there &apos;s a kernel of truth thought to be important , passed down from generation to generation , so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior ?
To do that , I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology , and a worldwide search , again , led to the University of W.A.
And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us , confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white , or grayscale .
So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government .
The first is that we mapped the characteristics , the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks , so the great white , tiger and bull shark .
The next thing we did was to understand , using complex computer modeling , at different depths , distances , light conditions , and water clarity in the ocean .
The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear , and to that end , I invited Ray Smith , a surfer , industrial designer , wetsuit designer , and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo , to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear .
So this is what I call a &quot; don &apos;t eat me &quot; wetsuit .
And this one &apos;s configured to go with a surfboard .
Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit , or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column .
And this one &apos;s particularly well-suited to the dive configuration , so when you &apos;re deeper under the water .
We knew , if you wanted to stand out , you needed to look stripy , and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic , you needed to look like this .
And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think .
We can &apos;t put humans in the water .
But nevertheless , we started the testing process in January of this year , initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks .
And because we use stereo , we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is , what angle it comes in at , how quickly it leaves , and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way .
And the results were not just exciting , but very encouraging , and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements .
Now that exact same shark had engaged , or encountered this SAMS rig , which is the Elude SAMS rig , about eight minutes before , and spent six minutes circling it , hunting for it , looking for what it could smell and sense but not see , and this was the final engagement .
In contrast to the SAMS technology rig , this is the banded one , where it &apos;s more tactile , it &apos;s more investigative , it &apos;s more apprehensive , and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go .
It &apos;ll be an ongoing process .
It &apos;s so important that this concept is led with the science .
We &apos;ll license others to do that .
So I can welcome Sam , the surfer , from this side . Where are you , Sam ?
Cheers , mate .
Thanks , gentlemen . So what have we done here ?
And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation .
As for the humble wetsuit , who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years &apos; time , in five years &apos; time or in 50 years &apos; time , but with this new thinking , I &apos;m guessing there &apos;s a fair chance it won &apos;t be pure black .
Sarah Lewis : Embrace the near win
I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray .
After the curator Robert Storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work , I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s .
I remember asking her what she thought of those early works .
She told me that a few didn &apos;t quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be .
In that moment , my view of success and creativity changed .
But this is the thing : What gets us to convert success into mastery ?
I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win .
I wanted to see what &apos;s called archer &apos;s paradox , the idea that in order to actually hit your target , you have to aim at something slightly skew from it .
One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching .
I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support , and watched her , and I didn &apos;t understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring .
And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight on each shot .
And I saw that gave her more tenacity , and she went after it again and again .
At the end of the practice , one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star-fished , her head looking up at the sky , trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world .
But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what &apos;s so rare to glimpse , that difference between success and mastery .
Mastery is not just the same as excellence , though .
Mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit .
How many times have we designated something a classic , a masterpiece even , while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished , riddled with difficulties and flaws , in other words , a near win ?
Painter Paul Cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again , but at the end of his life , the result was that he had only signed 10 percent of his paintings .
Franz Kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise , so much so that he wanted all of his diaries , manuscripts , letters and even sketches burned upon his death .
The pursuit of mastery , in other words , is an ever-onward almost .
Mastery is in the reaching , not the arriving .
Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career .
We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders , who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement , but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins .
It &apos;s a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington , who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one , always the one he had yet to compose .
It &apos;s called the Dunning – Kruger effect .
and he said , &quot; You learn how little you know . &quot;
One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition .
We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch-off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart-stoppers , and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the 1970s .
If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week , you might describe it in more general terms .
And this is what a near win does .
It &apos;s Jackie Joyner-Kersee , who in 1984 missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second , and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition .
We thrive not when we &apos;ve done it all , but when we still have more to do .
We know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge , and it &apos;s why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths .
It &apos;s what &apos;s called a spirit line , a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out , but also a reason to continue making work .
They &apos;re masters because they realize that there isn &apos;t one .
It didn &apos;t sound like a complaint , exactly , but just a way to let me know , a kind of tender admission , to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious , unfinished path that always required more .
This is the dynamic of mastery .
It &apos;s what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray was thinking when I saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries .
Completion is a goal , but we hope it is never the end .
Jeremy Kasdin : The flower-shaped starshade that might help us detect Earth-like planets
The universe is teeming with planets .
My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years .
We &apos;ve only detected them indirectly .
It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away .
Why haven &apos;t we done that ? Why is that hard ?
We &apos;ll see something like that , a slightly blurry picture of the Earth , because we &apos;re a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars .
Here we are at the orbit of Uranus .
We can still see the little moon , but let &apos;s go ten times further away again .
Now it &apos;s not resolved at all .
But let &apos;s move yet again ten times further away .
One more time , ten times further away .
All we &apos;re seeing is the big beaming image of the star that &apos;s ten billion times brighter than the planet , which should be in that little red circle .
The light from the star is diffracting .
So to see the planet , we have to do something about all of that light .
I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that , but I want to tell you about one today and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade .
You &apos;ve all seen that . That &apos;s a solar eclipse .
It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it .
Well , what &apos;s going on ?
We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow , we look back at the sun , and most of the light &apos;s been removed and we can see that dim , fine structure in the corona .
We build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that &apos;s created , and boom , we get to see planets .
So there &apos;s that big screen , and there &apos;s no planets , because unfortunately it doesn &apos;t actually work very well , because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope .
It &apos;s a terrible shadow . And we can &apos;t see planets .
If we can feather the edges , soften those edges so we can control diffraction , well then we can see a planet , and in the last 10 years or so we &apos;ve come up with optimal solutions for doing that .
We call that our flower petal starshade .
It &apos;s about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before , and we can see the planets beam out just like that .
That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow , and then we can see those planets .
It starts wrapped around a hub .
The petals unfurl , they open up , the telescope turns around .
It &apos;s going to move in front of the star just like that , creates a wonderful shadow .
Thank you .
We &apos;ve been working on this for the last five or six years .
So those are four petals .
It &apos;s about half the size of the one you just saw .
Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL .
Those petals have to rotate into place .
We ran this test 16 times , and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter .
That &apos;s a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope .
We &apos;re hoping it &apos;ll be someone else &apos;s solar system as seen through an occulter , through a starshade like that .
We want to see that , see if there &apos;s water , oxygen , ozone , the things that might tell us that it could harbor life .
That &apos;s why I got into doing this , because I think that will change the world .
Thank you .
The parenting section of the bookstore is overwhelming — it &apos;s &quot; a giant , candy-colored monument to our collective panic , &quot; as writer Jennifer Senior puts it . Why is parenthood filled with so much anxiety ? Because the goal of modern , middle-class parents — to raise happy children — is so elusive . In this honest talk , she offers some kinder and more achievable aims .
Thank you for indulging me .
No , it was Benjamin Spock , and his book was called &quot; The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care . &quot;
Today , I , as the mother of a six-year-old , walk into Barnes and Noble , and see this .
There are guides to raising an eco-friendly kid , a gluten-free kid , a disease-proof kid , which , if you ask me , is a little bit creepy .
There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science-minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga .
All of these books are well-intentioned .
But taken together , I am sorry , I do not see help when I look at that shelf .
I see a giant candy-colored monument to our collective panic , and it makes me want to know , why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion ?
Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis ?
There was , in fact , a paper of just this very name , &quot; Parenthood as Crisis , &quot; published in 1957 , and in the 50-plus years since , there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish .
Their marital satisfaction is lower .
Last year , I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very , very imaginative project that tracks people &apos;s happiness , and here is what he told me he found : &quot; Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse , which is better than interacting with other relatives , which is better than interacting with acquaintances , which is better than interacting with parents , which is better than interacting with children .
But here &apos;s the thing .
Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem .
Parent , as a verb , only entered common usage in 1970 .
The roles of our children have changed .
So how did we get here ?
Well , for starters , there has been a major historical change .
Kids were considered economic assets .
We recognized kids had rights , we banned child labor , we focused on education instead , and school became a child &apos;s new work .
But that only made a parent &apos;s role more confusing in a way .
We provided food , clothing , shelter , and moral instruction to our kids , and they in return provided income .
Kids became , in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist , &quot; economically worthless but emotionally priceless . &quot;
Today , extracurricular activities are a kid &apos;s new work , but that &apos;s work for us too , because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice .
About three years ago , a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart .
The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids , even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give .
It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for .
We have no clue what portion our wisdom , if any , is of use to our kids .
This was true even when I was young .
And with all due respect to the Japanese , it didn &apos;t turn out that way .
So , absent being able to anticipate the future , what we all do , as good parents , is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future , hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off .
We sign them up for team sports , thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills , you know , for when they go to Harvard Business School .
I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef .
I pay my taxes .
I was even invited to speak at TED .
So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf , because we feel like if we aren &apos;t trying everything , it &apos;s as if we &apos;re doing nothing and we &apos;re defaulting on our obligations to our kids .
Now add to this problem something else : we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce .
We have no rules , no scripts , no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners .
He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs , because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this : &quot; So , did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning ? &quot;
Mothers are much more likely to be multi-tasking when they are at home , and fathers , when they are at home , are much more likely to be mono-tasking .
In fact , UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle-class homes .
Dad in a room by himself .
But here is the thing : Men are doing plenty .
They work more paid hours , on average , than their wives , and they genuinely want to be good , involved dads .
Either way , by the way , if you think it &apos;s hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles , just imagine what it &apos;s like now for non-traditional families : families with two dads , families with two moms , single-parent households .
Now , in a more progressive country , and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché and invoking , yes , Sweden , parents could rely on the state for support .
Unfortunately , the United States is not one of them , so in case you were wondering what the U.S.
We are one of eight known countries that does not .
That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless .
The one mantra no parent ever questions is , &quot; All I want is for my children to be happy . &quot;
But it is a very elusive one .
It &apos;s not like teaching them how to ride a bike .
Happiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things , but they cannot really be goals unto themselves .
And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid .
We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world &apos;s ugliness that we now shield them from &quot; Sesame Street . &quot;
Can I just repeat that ?
When asked about this by The New York Times , a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations .
Bad modeling . I don &apos;t know .
I cannot tell you how much this distresses me .
The offending muppet , right there .
I was high as a kite on morphine .
But even in my opiate haze , I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him .
I said , &quot; I will try so hard not to hurt you . &quot;
But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness .
All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back .
I &apos;m not really sure how to create new norms for this world , but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids , we may be assuming the wrong moral burden .
That , anyway , is one response to having no script .
I think if we all did that , the kids would still be all right , and so would their parents , possibly in both cases even better .
David Brooks : Should you live for your résumé ... or your eulogy ?
So I &apos;ve been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues .
The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy , which are deeper : who are you , in your depth , what is the nature of your relationships , are you bold , loving , dependable , consistency ?
But at least in my case , are they the ones that I think about the most ? And the answer is no .
Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures , which he called Adam I and Adam II .
He wants to build , create , create companies , create innovation .
Adam II wants not only to do good but to be good , to live in a way internally that honors God , creation and our possibilities .
Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
Adam II savors inner consistency and strength .
Adam II asks why we &apos;re here .
Adam II &apos;s motto is &quot; love , redemption and return . &quot;
We live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value .
The external logic is an economic logic : input leads to output , risk leads to reward .
You have to give to receive .
You have to conquer the desire to get what you want .
In order to find yourself , you have to lose yourself .
And the problem is , that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game , and you become a cold , calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there &apos;s a difference between your desired self and your actual self .
You don &apos;t have the depth of conviction .
You don &apos;t have commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit .
Through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses .
And we &apos;re often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves , in that we &apos;re not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it , how to confront it , and how to combat it .
Finally , Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation , the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life , this way : &quot; Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime ; therefore we must be saved by hope .
Nothing we do , however virtuous , can be accomplished alone ; therefore we must be saved by love .
Therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . &quot; Thanks .
On January 8 , 2011 , Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot in the head while meeting constituents in her home town of Tucson , Arizona . Her husband , the astronaut Mark Kelly , immediately flew to be by her side . In this emotional conversation with Pat Mitchell , the pair describe their lives both before and after the accident -- and describe their views on responsible gun ownership .
You were both doing the work that you love .
And suddenly , everything that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever .
People don &apos;t realize that .
Gabby Giffords : Yes .
She didn &apos;t have much other information .
A few minutes later , I called her back and I actually thought for a second , well , maybe I just imagined getting this phone call .
And from that point on , I knew that our lives were going to be a lot different .
Well , for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury , they typically can &apos;t tell you much .
So they didn &apos;t know how long Gabby would be in a coma , didn &apos;t know when that would change and what the prognosis would be .
GG : The new one -- better , stronger , tougher .
I don &apos;t know anybody that &apos;s as tough as my wonderful wife right here .
Well , the first thing , for me , was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious , but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant , in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next , and at that point I knew that she was still in there .
Didn &apos;t she surprise you with words in the beginning ?
Yeah , that was it .
For some reason , she has aphasia , which is difficulty with communication .
And we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that .
GG : Talking . Really hard . Really .
She understands everything , but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture , the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head , which is where the bullet passed through .
I do .
PM : Gabby , are you optimistic about your continuing recovery -- walking , talking , being able to move your arm and leg ?
PM : That seems to be the number one characteristic of Gabby Giffords , wouldn &apos;t you say ? Gabby &apos;s always been really optimistic .
GG : On the treadmill , walked on my treadmill , Spanish lessons , French horn .
PM : Well , let &apos;s take a little closer look at the wife , and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords .
Yeah , Gabby , she used to race motorcycles .
PM : Does she ride it ? Well , that &apos;s a challenge with not being able to move her right arm , but I think with something I know about , Velcro , we might be able to get her back on the bike , Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar .
But you meet , you &apos;re already decided that you &apos;re going to dedicate your life to service .
So you meet .
Well , when we met , oddly enough , it was the last time we were in Vancouver , about 10 years ago . We met in Vancouver , at the airport , on a trip that we were both taking to China , that I would actually , from my background , I would call it a boondoggle .
She would call it an important fact-finding mission .
PM : Would you describe it as a whirlwind romance ?
A good friend .
GG : Yes . And then she invited me on , about a year or so later , she invited me on a date .
GG : Death row .
They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of Arizona .
So that was our first date .
PM : Well , that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you .
I guess .
GG : Um , good friends . Best friends . Best friends .
We &apos;ve gone through some tough times and it &apos;s only made it stronger . GG : Stronger .
Actually , you didn &apos;t even live together .
In our case , it was Washington , D.C. , Houston , Tucson .
Within an hour of Gabby being shot , I was on an airplane to Tucson , and that was the moment where that had changed things .
What did you like best about being in Congress ?
PM : Well it was the way you did it . GG : Yes , yes . Fast pace .
Yeah , you know , legislation is often at a colossally slow pace , but my wife , and I have to admit , a lot of other members of Congress that I know , work incredibly hard .
PM : Installing solar panels on the top of her house , So after the tragic incident , Mark , you decided to resign your position as an astronaut , even though you were supposed to take the next space mission .
Kind of . The day after Gabby was injured , I called my boss , the chief astronaut , Dr. Peggy Whitson , and I said , &quot; Peggy , I know I &apos;m launching in space in three months from now .
You &apos;ve got to find a replacement for me . &quot;
Months later , maybe about two months later , I started about getting my job back , which is something , when you become this primary caregiver person , which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position , it &apos;s a challenging role but at some point you &apos;ve got to figure out when you &apos;re going to get your life back , and at the time , I couldn &apos;t ask Gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again .
She was the biggest supporter of my career , and I knew it was the right thing to do .
Now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in Tucson for the first time , Gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of Tupperware that has the real skull . GG : The real skull . Which freaks people out , sometimes .
Well , it just gets the conversation going .
You had to make another step of courage too , because here was Congress deadlocked again , and you got out of the rehabilitation center , got yourself to Washington so that you could walk on the floor of the House -- I can barely talk about this without getting emotional — and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote .
Yeah , we had that vote , I guess about five months after Gabby was injured , and she made this bold decision to go back .
PM : And after that , resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery .
Well , that &apos;s Gabby &apos;s service dog Nelson .
New member of our family . GG : Yes , yes .
But she did a great job with this dog .
PM : So Gabby , what have you learned from your experiences the past few years ?
PM : Your relationship is deeper .
I imagine being grateful , too , right ?
PM : This is a picture of family and friends gathering , but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now .
I think when something tragic happens in a family , it can pull people together .
PM : And of course , the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery , and yet , Gabby , how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook ?
PM : And you &apos;re doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you .
And Gabby , what &apos;s on the agenda now ?
That &apos;s our political action committee , where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country , and to try to pass some reasonable legislation .
It was really the 20 murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown , Connecticut , and the response that we saw afterwards where -- well , look what &apos;s happened so far .
We &apos;re trying to change that .
What are you doing that &apos;s different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities ?
At the same time , we &apos;ve got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill .
This issue , like many others , has become very polarizing and political , and we &apos;re trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington .
And not surprisingly for this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure , you just keep challenging yourself , and the sky seems to be the limit .
Take a look at Gabby .
You okay ? You did great . GG : Yes , it &apos;s gorgeous . Thank you .
Mountains . Gorgeous mountains .
Gabby visited him when he was at Bethesda and went through a really tough period .
Months later , Gabby was shot in the head , and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in Houston .
GG : Yes .
Because this is the TED stage , Gabby , I know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience .
Hello , everyone .
It &apos;s been a long , hard haul , but I &apos;m getting better .
But my spirit is strong as ever .
Get involved with your community .
Be passionate . Be courageous .
Thank you . GG : Thank you .
David Sengeh : The sore problem of prosthetic limbs
I was born and raised in Sierra Leone , a small and very beautiful country in West Africa , a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent .
An estimated 8,000 men , women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time .
They would , in fact , be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power .
The reason , I would come to find out , was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well .
Even in the developed world , it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket , if ever .
Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient , leaving them with pressure sores and blisters .
If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable , you will not use your leg , and that is just simply unacceptable in our age .
And so , for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab , I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses .
We use a 3D printer to create a multi-material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient .
In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab , one of our patients , a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about 20 years and worn dozens of legs , said of one of our printed parts , &quot; It &apos;s so soft , it &apos;s like walking on pillows , and it &apos;s effing sexy . &quot;
My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them .
Whether it &apos;s in Sierra Leone or in Boston , I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential .
Hidden miracles of the natural world
What is the intersection between technology , art and science ?
And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space , to make the invisible visible , it expands our horizons , it transforms our perception , it opens our minds and it touches our heart .
There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect , and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life .
And at the grand scale , time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion .
Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane , and by turning air traffic data into time-lapse imagery , we can see something that &apos;s above us constantly but invisible : the vast network of air travel over the United States .
We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion .
It may be the ultimate time-lapse image : the anatomy of Earth brought to life .
We can shoot images that are thousands of times And we can see how nature &apos;s ingenious devices work , and perhaps we can even imitate them .
It can hover , fly backwards , even upside down .
Nobody knew the secret , but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places .
The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times .
And there are unseen creatures living all over your body , including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes , crawling over your skin at night .
Shark skin .
The eye of a fruit fly .
A flea .
We think we know most of the animal kingdom , but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered .
This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world .
On there is bacteria , and near that bacteria , 10 times smaller , a virus .
With the tip of a powerful microscope , we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices .
Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day , perhaps , repair DNA .
So under an endless rain of cosmic dust , the air is full of pollen , micro-diamonds and jewels from other planets , and supernova explosions .
Knowing that there &apos;s so much around us we can see forever changes our understanding of the world , and by looking at unseen worlds , we recognize that we exist in the living universe , and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards .
We &apos;ll just have to see .
Christopher Emdin : Teach teachers how to create magic
Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a 60-page paper based on some age-old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she &apos;s engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life , which is be an educator , change lives , and spark magic .
Right now there &apos;s a first-year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards , who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately , while at the same time saying to herself over and over again , &quot; Don &apos;t smile till November , &quot; because that &apos;s what she was taught in her teacher education program .
On the other hand , right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information , information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge .
Right now there &apos;s a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says , &quot; Put them down . &quot;
So people will then say , &quot; Well , Chris , you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you &apos;re also describing these powerful educators .
The reality is , the folks I described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms .
They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education .
It &apos;s sad because the people who I described , they were very disinterested in the learning process , want to be effective teachers , but they have no models .
Mark Twain says that proper preparation , or teaching , is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good , it can turn awful practices into powerful ones , it can change men and transform them into angels .
Guess where those places are ?
And I &apos;ve been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy .
We got a couple of hands .
So he says , &quot; Can I get an amen ? &quot;
Chris Emdin : So I can I get an amen ? Audience : Amen .
That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention .
So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills , that magic that you need to engage an audience , to engage a student ?
Now people oftentimes say , &quot; Well , magic is just magic . &quot;
And when they try to describe what that is , they just say , &quot; He has that magic . &quot;
Magic can be taught .
Now , how do you teach it ?
If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education , you &apos;ve got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood .
At our teacher education classes at my university , I &apos;ve started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts .
They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage .
They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch , you don &apos;t have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more .
Thank you .
More than 8 million people are crowded together to live in New York City . What makes it possible ? In part , it &apos;s the city &apos;s great public spaces — from tiny pocket parks to long waterfront promenades — where people can stroll and play . Amanda Burden helped plan some of the city &apos;s newest public spaces , drawing on her experience as , surprisingly , an animal behaviorist . She shares the unexpected challenges of planning parks people love -- and why it &apos;s important .
They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers , noisy cabs .
Cities are fundamentally about people , and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work .
And today , some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces .
They are what makes it come alive .
What attracts people to successful public spaces , and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away ?
But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist , and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces .
This little space became a small phenomenon , and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers , it made an enormous impression on me .
I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail .
Well , I would sit in the park and watch very carefully , and first among other things were the comfortable , movable chairs .
And it was green .
But my question was , why weren &apos;t there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn &apos;t feel alone , or like a trespasser ?
So here you see a familiar sight .
They have that stylish , Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture , but it &apos;s not surprising that people avoid spaces like this .
I mean , where would you sit here ?
But architects love them .
They might tolerate a sculpture or two , but that &apos;s about it .
There &apos;s nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
For me , becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved .
But over the many years , I have learned how hard it is to create successful , meaningful , enjoyable public spaces .
Now , open spaces in cities are opportunities .
The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s , when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River .
So we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
So we only could afford to build a two-block section of what would become a mile-long esplanade , so whatever we built had to be perfect .
And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me , the railing hit exactly at eye level , blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water &apos;s edge .
But design is not just how something looks , it &apos;s how your body feels on that seat in that space , and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience .
Now , this proved very valuable 20 years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York .
And he asked me , &quot; So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers ? &quot;
Now , you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants , so we were excited about the prospect of growth , but honestly , where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water ?
And if we couldn &apos;t spread out , which was probably a good thing , where could new housing go ?
Our city couldn &apos;t possibly handle any more cars .
If we couldn &apos;t spread out , we had to go up .
So that meant using one of our greatest assets : our transit system .
So here was the answer to our puzzle .
And so here was the plan , what we really needed to do : We needed to redo our zoning -- and zoning is the city planner &apos;s regulatory tool -- and basically reshape the entire city , targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car-oriented , suburban-style neighborhoods .
So how was I going to get this done ?
You know , communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods .
And so I began walking .
I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert , finding ways that zoning could address communities &apos; concerns .
Over the course of 12 years , we were able to rezone 124 neighborhoods , 40 percent of the city , 12,500 blocks , so that now , 90 percent of all new development of New York is within a 10-minute walk of a subway .
Well , those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important , but rezoning was never my mission .
My mission was always to create great public spaces .
Here you see what was two miles of abandoned , degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn , impossible to get to and impossible to use .
I wanted to make sure that there were tree-lined paths from the upland to the water , that there were trees and plantings everywhere , and , of course , lots and lots of places to sit .
I had to have faith .
And then it opened , and I have to tell you , it was incredible .
I know they changed the lives of the people who live there , but they also changed New Yorkers &apos; whole image of their city .
And here is a new park in lower Manhattan .
Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn &apos;t get anywhere near this edge .
But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan .
Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides .
You know , railings have to be higher now , so we put bar seating at the edge , and you can get so close to the water you &apos;re practically on it .
And I love when people come there and look up and they say , &quot; Wow , there &apos;s Brooklyn , and it &apos;s so close . &quot;
How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be ?
You don &apos;t tap into your design expertise .
I mean , would you want to go there ?
Can you see into it and out of it ?
Does it seem green and friendly ?
Well now , all over New York City , there are places where you can find your very own seat .
Where Broadway traffic used to run , there are now tables and chairs .
But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple , and it &apos;s even harder to keep them that way .
The High Line was an elevated railway .
And when I saw it the first time , honestly , when I went up on that old viaduct , I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person , honestly .
I knew if there was a day that I didn &apos;t worry about the High Line , it would come down .
You might see a beautiful park , but not everyone does .
You might say , &quot; How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line . &quot;
Hey , why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line ?
Well no , it would not be terrific .
And you know what , it might mean more money for the city , but a city has to take the long view , the view for the common good .
And they came to me and proposed that they &quot; temporarily disassemble &quot; that third and final section .
Perhaps it was just in their way .
So you see , no matter how popular and successful a public space may be , it can never be taken for granted .
If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner , it is that public spaces have power .
Public space can change how you live in a city , how you feel about a city , whether you choose one city over another , and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city .
People stay because they are having a great time .
Thank you .
Seven years ago , Internet activist Aaron Swartz convinced Lawrence Lessig to take up the fight for political reform . A year after Swartz &apos;s tragic death , Lessig continues his campaign to free US politics from the stranglehold of corruption . In this fiery , deeply personal talk , he calls for all citizens to engage , and offers a heartfelt reminder to never give up hope .
It &apos;s just about 20 years ago , June 1994 , when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip .
So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every 27,000 years .
The community , the techies , said , this flaw has to be addressed .
So there was a revolution across the world .
And Intel set aside 475 million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw .
Number two , a poet .
You &apos;re familiar with his poetry .
Then they came for the socialists .
Then they came for the Jews .
But there was no one left to speak for me . &quot;
This is an insight at the core of intelligence .
It &apos;s a certain kind of test : Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond ?
Turns out ants are pretty good at this .
So can you see the pattern ?
Number three , a boy .
He &apos;s Tim &apos;s friend .
It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk .
And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient , and he said , &quot; So how are you ever going to solve the problems you &apos;re talking about ?
So I was a little put off by this .
And I said to him , &quot; You know , Aaron , it &apos;s not my field , not my field . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah , as an academic , it &apos;s not my field . &quot;
As a citizen . &quot;
He didn &apos;t tell . He asked questions .
He was saying to me , &quot; You &apos;ve got to get a clue .
It is every time , every single important issue .
We &apos;ve got to adopt , it turns out , the word is fourmi-formatic attitude -- that &apos;s what the Internet tells me the word is -- the ant &apos;s appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw , save our kind and save our demos .
It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk , and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk , not because I had the chance to talk to you , although that was great , but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression .
Because I had to focus .
It saved me .
We &apos;d begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement , because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important .
But it was another soul that caught my imagination , a woman named Doris Haddock , aka Granny D.
She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington , D.C.
Eighteen months later , at the age of 90 , she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her , including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her .
I &apos;ve got three kids who hate to walk , and a wife who , it turns out , still hates when I &apos;m not there for mysterious reasons , so this was not an option , but the question I asked , could we remix Granny D a bit ?
So on January 11 , the anniversary of Aaron &apos;s death , we began a walk that ended on January 24th , the day that Granny D was born .
And what was astonishing to me , something I completely did not expect to find , was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue .
Now politicians and pundits tell you , there &apos;s nothing we can do about this issue , Americans don &apos;t care about it , but the reason for that is that 91 percent of Americans think there &apos;s nothing that can be done about this issue .
I mean , after all , at least 96 percent of us wish we could fly like Superman , but because at least 91 percent of us believe we can &apos;t , we don &apos;t leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge .
But when you give people the sense of hope , you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility .
Hope .
I loved that boy like I love my son .
And I love my country , and I &apos;m not going to fail that .
That sense of hope , we &apos;re going to hold , and we &apos;re going to fight for , however impossible this battle looks .
Well , we started with this march with 200 people , and next year , there will be 1,000 on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause , and then in 2016 , before the primary , there will be 10,000 who march across that state , meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause .
So we &apos;ve started a platform called G.D. Walkers , that is , Granny D walkers , and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform . Number one .
And so they developed a platform , which we are announcing today , that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform .
And then finally number three , the hardest .
Indeed yesterday , Merriam announced that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word .
So on May 1 , aka May Day , we &apos;re going to try an experiment .
And the basic way this works is this .
What is that number ? Half a billion ? A billion ?
And then whatever that number is , we are going to kickstart , sort of , because you can &apos;t use KickStarter for political work , but anyway , kickstart , sort of , first a bottom-up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals , and when those goals have been reached , we will turn to the large dollar contributors , to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue , to change the way money influences politics , so that on November 8 , which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been 30 years old , on November 8 , we will celebrate 218 representatives in the House and 60 Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform .
Here &apos;s my wish .
May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people , we are the people who were promised a government , a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone , the people , who , as Madison told us , meant not the rich more than the poor .
And then may you , may you join this movement , not because you &apos;re a politician , not because you &apos;re an expert , not because this is your field , but because if you are , you are a citizen .
Now I &apos;ve asked you .
Jennifer Golbeck : The curly fry conundrum : Why social media &quot; likes &quot; say more than you might think
If you remember that first decade of the web , it was really a static place .
And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early 2000s , the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users , either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings .
So Facebook is not the only place you can do this , but it &apos;s the biggest , and it serves to illustrate the numbers .
So half the Earth &apos;s Internet population is using Facebook .
So the result is that we have behavioral , preference , demographic data for hundreds of millions of people , which is unprecedented in history .
As scientists , we use that to help the way people interact online , but there &apos;s less altruistic applications , and there &apos;s a problem in that users don &apos;t really understand these techniques and how they work , and even if they did , they don &apos;t have a lot of control over it .
So this is Target , the company .
You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant .
He said , &quot; How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents ? &quot;
And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things , like , she &apos;s buying a crib or baby clothes , but things like , she bought more vitamins than she normally had , or she bought a handbag that &apos;s big enough to hold diapers .
So that &apos;s the kind of thing that we do when we &apos;re predicting stuff about you on social media .
So in my lab and with colleagues , we &apos;ve developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference , your personality score , gender , sexual orientation , religion , age , intelligence , along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are .
And again , it doesn &apos;t come from what you might think of as obvious information .
If you Google this , you &apos;ll find it .
And they looked at just people &apos;s Facebook likes , so just the things you like on Facebook , and used that to predict all these attributes , along with some other ones .
And among those was liking a page for curly fries . Curly fries are delicious , but liking them does not necessarily mean that you &apos;re smarter than the average person .
And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we &apos;re able to do this .
So if you &apos;re smart , you tend to be friends with smart people , and if you &apos;re young , you tend to be friends with young people , and this is well established for hundreds of years .
It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks .
We have good models of it .
So if I were to give you a hypothesis , it would be that a smart guy started this page , or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test .
So this is pretty complicated stuff , right ?
How do you know that you &apos;ve liked something that indicates a trait for you that &apos;s totally irrelevant to the content of what you &apos;ve liked ?
And I see that as a real problem going forward .
An example I often give is that , if I ever get bored being a professor , I &apos;m going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you &apos;re a drug user , if you &apos;re an alcoholic .
We totally can do that now .
That seems to me to be a problem .
And in some respects , I think that that would be most effective , but the problem is we &apos;d actually have to do it .
so users control their data .
The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting users &apos; data in some way .
And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users ?
So I think the other path that we can go down that &apos;s going to be more effective is one of more science .
that we &apos;d have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user , &quot; Here &apos;s the risk of that action you just took . &quot;
And that , I think , can affect whether or not people want to share something , keep it private , or just keep it offline altogether .
This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective , and so scientists are going to be willing to do it .
One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is , they say , you know , if people start keeping all this data private , all those methods that you &apos;ve been developing to predict their traits are going to fail .
And sometimes that involves inferring things about them , but if users don &apos;t want me to use that data , I think they should have the right to do that .
And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward , as these tools evolve and advance , means that we &apos;re going to have an educated and empowered user base , and I think all of us can agree that that &apos;s a pretty ideal way to go forward .
Bill and Melinda Gates : Why giving away our wealth has been the most satisfying thing we &apos;ve done
So , this is an interview with a difference .
So , we &apos;re going to start here .
Melinda Gates : With those big glasses , huh ?
We were already engaged to be married .
It was incredible . Bill had never taken that much time off from work .
We started asking ourselves questions .
And at the end of the trip , we went out to Zanzibar , and took some time to walk on the beach , which is something we had done a lot while we were dating .
So , given that this vacation led to the creation of the world &apos;s biggest private foundation , it &apos;s pretty expensive as vacations go . MG : I guess so . We enjoyed it .
Bill Gates : Well , I think we were excited that there &apos;d be a phase of our life where we &apos;d get to work together and figure out how to give this money back .
Were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
Our naïveté is pretty incredible , when we look back on it .
MG : Which Bill always thought was going to come after he was 60 , so he hasn &apos;t quite hit 60 yet , so some things change along the way .
So that was &apos; 93 , and it was &apos; 97 , really , before the foundation itself started .
In the U.S. , you just go down to the drug store . &quot;
So , you &apos;ve got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues .
Well , we decided that we &apos;d pick two causes , whatever the biggest inequity was globally , and there we looked at children dying , children not having enough nutrition to ever develop , and countries that were really stuck , because with that level of death , and parents would have so many kids that they &apos;d get huge population growth , and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn &apos;t be educated and lift themselves up .
could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system , and the more we learned , the more we realized we &apos;re not really fulfilling that promise .
So , I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work , and Melinda , this is what you picked .
MG : So I , one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women , whether it &apos;s Bangladesh , India , lots of countries in Africa , and I go in as a Western woman without a name .
And I kept hearing from women , over and over and over , the more I traveled , &quot; I want to be able to use this shot . &quot;
which is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera , which is a contraceptive .
Well , you had to dig deeper into the reports , and this is what the team came to me with , which is , to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than 200 days a year explains why women were saying to me , &quot; I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it , and I got to the clinic , and there was nothing there . &quot;
and others supported .
I &apos;m either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS , and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children , and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them . &quot;
How do you navigate that ?
And even though I &apos;m Catholic , I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives , and I shouldn &apos;t let that controversy be the thing that holds us back .
Bill , this is your graph . What &apos;s this about ?
I really like this graph .
And what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known , that we are making incredible progress .
So this is a story largely of vaccines .
That was eradicated , so that got down to zero .
That &apos;s down to a few hundred thousand .
We can actually accelerate the progress .
I mean , you do the math on this , and it works out , I think , literally to thousands of kids &apos; lives saved every day compared to the prior year .
An airliner with 200-plus deaths is a far , far bigger story than that .
Yeah , because it &apos;s a silent thing going on .
Ninety-eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters , and yet , people &apos;s charity , when they see a natural disaster , are wonderful .
These causes have been a bit invisible .
Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big , sad face to get engaged .
Yeah , well people can take , there is some aid that was well-meaning and didn &apos;t go well .
You shouldn &apos;t just say , okay , because of that , because we don &apos;t have a perfect record , this is a bad endeavor .
How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves , and say wow , this is going well , and be smarter .
It is not all a panacea .
Traditional wisdom is that it &apos;s pretty hard for married couples to work together .
MG : Yeah , I &apos;ve had a lot of women say to me , &quot; I really don &apos;t think I could work with my husband .
You know , we enjoy it , and we don &apos;t -- this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey , and we don &apos;t travel together as much for the foundation , actually , as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft .
He &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
But we don &apos;t every minute together , that &apos;s for sure .
Melinda , early on , you were basically largely running the show .
That must have been hard , adjusting to that . No ?
I was actually really excited .
And for me , the excitement of Bill putting his brain and his heart against these huge global problems , these inequities , to me that was exciting .
That &apos;s cool .
Including some of the employees .
No , I &apos;m kidding . MG : Oh , you mean , the employees didn &apos;t go away .
Sunday , 11 o &apos;clock , you &apos;re away from work , what comes up ? What &apos;s the argument ?
I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft .
She &apos;s got a lot of insight .
We &apos;ll take the different trips she described .
I can &apos;t think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another ?
MG : Well , here &apos;s the thing .
So Bill can look at the big data and say , &quot; I want to act based on these global statistics . &quot;
I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill &apos;s taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match , and I think what I &apos;ve taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand , can you actually deliver that vaccine ?
Because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science .
So , in vaccines and polio and so forth , you &apos;ve had some amazing successes .
Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you &apos;ve learned from it ?
We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you &apos;re going to have different failures .
Well , we got hundreds of ideas .
We were very naïve , certainly I was , about a drug for a disease in India , visceral leishmaniasis , that I thought , once I got this drug , we can just go wipe out the disease .
It took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
You &apos;re spending , like , a billion dollars a year in education , I think , something like that .
Are there any failures that you can talk about ?
They bring down the dropout rate .
But the thing that we learned from that work , and what turned out to be the fundamental key , is a great teacher in front of the classroom .
So Melinda , this is you and your eldest daughter , Jenn .
MG : So we went to Tanzania .
All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit , actually .
Anna and Sanare are the parents .
Actually , the goats had been there , I think , living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there .
And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound , and so let me just give you one explanation of that .
It was a very loving relationship .
Their children , their six children , the two in the middle were twins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named Grace .
She was very , very shy .
We kept trying to engage her , but she was shy .
Oh , wow .
He said , &quot; I don &apos;t know how I &apos;m going to pay for her education .
So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge , profound way .
Bringing up three children when you &apos;re the world &apos;s richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art .
What &apos;s been your approach ?
We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing .
You &apos;ve obviously guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons .
MG : Well , it &apos;s interesting .
And so as they get older and we are teaching them -- they have been to so many countries around the world — they &apos;re saying , we do want people to know that we believe in what you &apos;re doing , Mom and Dad , and it is okay to show us more .
But they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation , too .
Is that your plan for them ?
They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important .
Well , speaking of Warren Buffett , something really amazing happened in 2006 , when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America suddenly turned around and agreed to give 80 percent of his fortune to your foundation .
I guess there &apos;s a long version and a short version of that .
All right . Well , Warren was a close friend , and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away .
If he &apos;s got somebody who is doing something well , and is willing to do it at no charge , maybe that &apos;s okay . But we were stunned .
It &apos;s allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically .
And I think you &apos;ve pledged that by the time you &apos;re done , more than , or 95 percent of your wealth , will be given to the foundation .
And since this relationship , it &apos;s amazing — And recently , you and Warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give , what , more than half of their assets for philanthropy .
Well , we &apos;ve got about 120 people who have now taken this giving pledge .
We &apos;re not trying to homogenize it .
People give to some things .
But that &apos;s great .
We need more experimentation .
Now it looks like it &apos;ll just keep growing in size in the years ahead .
If they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy , they can change the world .
To me , that &apos;s the piece that &apos;s incredible .
There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people .
What &apos;s the pitch ?
The world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the past , and the U.S. tradition here , which is the strongest , is the envy of the world .
The world &apos;s got this terrible inequality , growing inequality problem that seems structural .
Is that a fair comment ?
It tries to balance out , and that &apos;s just .
In the U.S. , we &apos;re trying to change the education system so it &apos;s just for everybody and it works for all students .
That &apos;s the most important .
Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do .
Thank you . MG : Thank you very much .
Allan Adams : The discovery that could rewrite physics
If you look deep into the night sky , you see stars , and if you look further , you see more stars , and further , galaxies , and further , more galaxies .
Now , the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small , incredibly hot , incredibly roiling mass , and from it sprung everything we see .
We &apos;ve mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision , and one of the shocks about it is that it &apos;s almost completely uniform .
Now it &apos;s been 14 billion years since that Big Bang , and so it &apos;s got faint and cold .
But it &apos;s not exactly 2.7 degrees .
Over here , it &apos;s a little hotter , and over there , it &apos;s a little cooler , and that &apos;s incredibly important to everyone in this room , because where it was a little hotter , there was a little more stuff , and where there was a little more stuff , we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos .
That is spectacular , and that &apos;s not what they found on Monday ; what they found on Monday is cooler .
What happens ? It rings .
Now , that early universe was incredibly dense , like a metal , way denser , and if you hit it , it would ring , but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself , and the hammer would be quantum mechanics .
Those waves have long since faded .
Those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes .
So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper -- in fact , these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest , clearest , cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol , the signal , of gravitational waves , the ringing of the early universe .
And the thing that &apos;s so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing , though that is awesome .
It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble -- and this is the idea of inflation — one large bubble surrounded by something else .
This is a theory , an idea , that has been around for a while , and we never thought we we &apos;d really see it .
But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger , roiling pot of universal stuff .
And that amazes me .

Del Harvey : Protecting Twitter users
My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust , protect user rights and keep users safe , both from each other and , at times , from themselves .
Back in January 2009 , we saw more than two million new tweets each day January 2014 , more than 500 million .
That &apos;s a 24,900-percent increase .
There &apos;s no risk involved .
Sounds straightforward , right ?
Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities ?
It &apos;s the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale .
Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone .
Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia &apos;s Heart Reef , or tweeting about a concert they &apos;re attending , or sharing pictures of cute baby animals .
The sheer scale of what we &apos;re dealing with makes for a challenge .
People do weird things .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples that I &apos;ve run into during my time at Twitter -- these are all real examples — of situations that at first seemed cut and dried , but the truth of the matter was something altogether different .
We &apos;ll start off easy .
After all , why would you want to receive the message , &quot; Yo , bitch . &quot;
I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case .
And in fact , in that case , it &apos;s not only not abusive , it &apos;s technically just an accurate greeting .
Let &apos;s look at spam .
While this is a mockup I put together using my account , we see accounts doing this all the time .
We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior .
Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it .
Okay . Let &apos;s make the stakes higher .
This time it &apos;s sending the same message and link .
That &apos;s pretty clearly not a good thing .
So why are the stakes higher for this ?
We don &apos;t want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it .
Now , given the sorts of challenges I &apos;m up against , it &apos;s crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected .
It &apos;s an issue for anybody who &apos;s building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things .
I pause and I think , how could all of this go horribly wrong ?
And that &apos;s hard . There &apos;s a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that , like when you &apos;re writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement .
What do I mean by &quot; visualize catastrophe ? &quot;
Which happens to be my next example .
We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets .
You add a photo to your tweet , look at how much more content you &apos;ve got now .
My job isn &apos;t to think of those .
How could this picture lead to my death ?
There &apos;s more in that picture than just a cat .
When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there &apos;s a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
Sure , it &apos;s not likely that someone &apos;s going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat , but I start by assuming the worst will happen .
If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards , I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s just that for those of us dealing with scale , for those of us tasked with keeping people safe , we have to assume the worst will happen , because for us , a one-in-a-million chance is pretty good odds .
Ed Yong : Zombie roaches and other parasite tales
A herd of wildebeests , a shoal of fish , a flock of birds .
But why do these groups form ?
And that is often not the case .
You probably know it better as a sea monkey .
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm .
As a freelance journalist , I sympathize .
It castrates them , it changes their color from transparent to bright red , it makes them live longer , and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found , it makes them swim in groups .
The shrimp are just one step on its journey .
Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce , so to get there , it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour , and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm .
It &apos;s not safety in numbers .
The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies , turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo .
This is a suicidal cricket .
The worm grew to adult size within it , but it needs to get into water in order to mate , and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket &apos;s brain , causing it to behave erratically .
Crickets are really roomy . Who knew ?
They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind-controlling parasites , of fungi , viruses , and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts .
And I &apos;ve been writing about these creatures ever since .
It &apos;s like the parasites have subverted my own brain .
When you write about parasites , your lexicon swells with phrases like &quot; devoured alive &quot; and &quot; bursts out of its body . &quot;
I &apos;m a writer , and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories .
Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations .
Is it maybe protecting its siblings ?
This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it .
See what I mean ?
Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons .
We have a lot to get through . I only have 13 minutes . Now , some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world , that they are outliers , and that point of view is understandable , because by their nature , parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things .
A few years back , a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find , and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance .
Now , a single trematode is tiny , microscopic , but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds .
One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream , these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout .
It is a critical and common part of the world around us , and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators , and more excitingly , they &apos;re starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts .
This is Ampulex compressa , the emerald cockroach wasp , and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach .
This discovery came out three weeks ago .
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon .
The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to , but it doesn &apos;t choose to , because the venom nixes its motivation to walk , and only that .
And once there , she lays an egg on it , egg hatches , devoured alive , bursts out of body , yadda yadda yadda , you know the drill .
It &apos;s more of an extension of the wasp , just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm .
They have as much control over their own fates as my car .
Now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites .
Now , I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling .
Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind-controlling supervillains -- these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction , but in nature , they happen all the time .
If there are any — I &apos;ve got a red dot on my forehead now , don &apos;t I ?
This is Toxoplasma gondii , or Toxo , for short , because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname .
And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse , it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile .
The cat eats the rat . Toxo gets to have sex .
You &apos;re very charitable , generous people .
How does the parasite control its host in this way ?
We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine , a substance involved in reward and motivation .
But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear .
This has no nervous system . It has no consciousness .
But it &apos;s manipulating a mammal ?
We are more intelligent than a mere rat , to be sure , but our brains have the same basic structure , the same types of cells , the same chemicals running through them , and the same parasites .
Now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
But there &apos;s some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people , that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents , and there &apos;s some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected .
But given the widespread nature of such manipulations , it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren &apos;t similarly affected .
They &apos;re constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways , and to ask if the behaviors we &apos;re seeing , whether they &apos;re simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling , are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else .
At the end of &quot; On the Origin of Species , &quot; Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life , and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful , and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks .
Thank you .
When Bran Ferren was just 9 , his parents took him to see the Pantheon in Rome — and it changed everything . In that moment , he began to understand how the tools of science and engineering become more powerful when combined with art , with design and beauty . Ever since , he &apos;s been searching for a convincing modern-day equivalent to Rome &apos;s masterpiece . Stay tuned to the end of the talk for his unexpected suggestion .
When I was a little boy , I had an experience that changed my life , and is in fact why I &apos;m here today .
As background , I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world &apos;s great cities .
He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who , together with his contemporaries , invented American modern art , and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century .
As with many other important innovations , those radical ideas required no new technology , just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment , plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection .
It was like oxygen , around us and necessary for life .
Given this rich artistic environment , you &apos;d assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business , but no .
I had no interest in becoming an artist , certainly not a painter .
Fortunately , my family also had engineers in it , and with my parents , these were my first role models .
My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn .
There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics , and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers .
I learned about engineering and how things worked , not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices .
Life was good .
We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East , but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology , they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum , where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology .
On one particularly hot summer day , we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting .
It didn &apos;t look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things : First of all , it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside .
Dad explained that this wasn &apos;t a big open hole , but it was called the oculus , an eye to the heavens .
As we walked to the center of the room , I looked up at the heavens through the oculus .
But I wondered , what about when it rained ?
I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor .
No big deal here , just the same statuary stuff that we &apos;d seen all over Rome .
But the ceiling was amazing .
I &apos;d seen these before , and Bucky was friends with my dad .
I loved this place .
He said , &quot; About 2,000 years ago . &quot;
You see , I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long-past war .
That moment changed my life , and I can remember it as if it were yesterday .
I mean , to me , the pyramids at Giza , we visited those the year before , and sure they &apos;re impressive , nice enough design , but look , give me an unlimited budget , 20,000 to 40,000 laborers , and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside , and I &apos;ll build you pyramids too .
And incidentally , it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that &apos;s ever been built .
By miracles , I mean things that are technically barely possible , very high-risk , and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time , certainly not by you .
To make it even structurally possible , they had to invent super-strong concrete , and to control weight , varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome .
It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass , natural convection of air rising up through the oculus , and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building .
The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable , and I realized for the first time that light could be designed .
I also realized that I wasn &apos;t the first person to think that this place was really special .
Largely because of that visit , I came to understand that , contrary to what I was being told in school , the worlds of art and design were not , in fact , incompatible with science and engineering .
But in school , with few exceptions , they were treated as separate worlds , and they still are .
However , urging me to specialize only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , Benjamin Franklin , people who did exactly the opposite .
So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen ?
They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it , and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther .
The problem is , no matter how talented , rich or smart you are , you only get one to one and a half miracles .
Then you run out of time , money , enthusiasm , whatever .
In my experience , these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art , design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach .
Take the oculus of the Pantheon .
However , by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution , they came up with a design that only works if there &apos;s a big hole in the roof .
Not bad .
Enough ancient history .
Well , putting a man on the moon was a good one , and returning him safely to Earth wasn &apos;t bad either .
So what came after the moon ?
The Internet isn &apos;t a Pantheon .
However , just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon , new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure .
Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one , and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure .
What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon ?
Why ? Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects , ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them , and will continue to do so indefinitely .
These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are , of course , critical , and fantastic , but they &apos;re part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology , like the Internet .
Perhaps counterintuitively , I &apos;m guessing it &apos;s a visionary idea from the late 1930s that &apos;s been revived every decade since : autonomous vehicles .
How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound ?
These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States .
Although perhaps not obvious today , autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and , by extension , civilization .
Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically .
They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live .
But why now ? Why do we think this is ready ?
It took folks like DARPA , universities , and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it , autonomy could be done now .
One , you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is .
You need to know where all the roads are , what the rules are , and where you &apos;re going .
You must have near-continuous communication with high-performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent .
You &apos;ll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this .
But finally , you need to recognize people , signs and objects .
Occasionally , humans will need to do sense-making .
Not so bad , and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world .
Five miracles , mostly delivered , and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home .
In conclusion , I &apos;ve come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us , just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge , multidisciplinary skills , and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality .
They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they &apos;re little kids .
We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success , as is perseverance .
But a cautionary note : We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles , the computers , phones , tablets , game machines and TVs , take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world , our planet and our civilization .
We also need them to understand something that doesn &apos;t seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech-dependent world , that art and design are not luxuries , nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering .
Someday , if you get the chance , perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon , as we will our daughter Kira , to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design , which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome , reached 2,000 years into the future to set the course for my life .
Charmian Gooch : My wish : To launch a new era of openness in business
I &apos;ve come here today to talk to you about a problem .
The problem is anonymous companies .
But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes .
Well , I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority , I don &apos;t think they knew where it might lead .
And a lot of my school teachers didn &apos;t appreciate it much either .
But why does the Earth go around the sun ?
But why do I have to go to school ?
And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do .
And as usual , we were talking about the world &apos;s problems .
And we had talked about that many , many times before .
And from that slightly crazy question , over two decades and many campaigns later , including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war , from that crazy question , Global Witness is now an 80-strong team of campaigners , investigators , journalists and lawyers .
So , what exactly does Global Witness do ?
And then we campaign hard to change the system itself .
And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices .
Now we &apos;ve come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations , like in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars .
Or in Liberia , where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia &apos;s unique forests .
Well , that uses anonymous companies too .
And the awful thing is , there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life .
Whether it &apos;s the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel , the Zetas , who use anonymous companies to launder profits while their drugs-related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas .
Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars , and not being able to find out who you were really up against .
As the Iranian government found out when , through a series of front companies , it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan , on Fifth Avenue , despite American sanctions .
There are just so many examples , the horesemeat scandal in Europe , the Italian mafia , they &apos;ve used these companies for decades .
Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine .
And it &apos;s just a simple truth that some of the people responsible for outrageous crimes , for stealing from you and me and millions of others , they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they &apos;re doing this with ease , and they &apos;re doing it using legal structures .
Well , you might well ask , what exactly is an anonymous company , and can I really set one up , and use it , without anyone knowing who I am ?
But if you &apos;re anything like me , you &apos;ll want to see some of that for yourself , so let me show you .
Now , at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here &apos;s the thing , shockingly , my own hometown , London , and indeed the U.K. , is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
Do you know , in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card , like Delaware , which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
These are the companies that can set your one up for you , and remember , it &apos;s all legal , routine business practice .
And having made your choice , you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact , name and address .
It can be your lawyer &apos;s or your service provider &apos;s , and it &apos;s not for the public record anyway .
Now this is the key part , and again it doesn &apos;t have to be you , because you can get creative , because there is a whole universe out there of nominees to choose from .
And if you don &apos;t want to involve anyone else , it doesn &apos;t even have to be an actual human being .
And then finally , give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment .
But there you are , in 10 minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company .
But the fun doesn &apos;t have to end there , maybe you want to be even more anonymous .
You can simply keep adding layers , companies owned by companies .
Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is .
It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual , but what about all of us , the public ?
And what does it all mean for us ?
And it &apos;s that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago .
Three thousand very happy revelers , many of them teenagers , were crammed into a space meant for 1,000 .
So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut .
Seven hundred were injured trying to get out .
And as they looked for the owners of the club , they found instead anonymous companies , and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies .
But this was an awful tragedy , and it shouldn &apos;t have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths .
Why should tax evaders , corrupt government officials , arms traders and more , be able to hide their identities from us , the public ?
Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn &apos;t always this way .
Companies were created to limit financial risk , they were never intended to be used as a moral shield .
And so I come to my wish .
Together let &apos;s ignite world opinion , change the law , and launch a new era of openness in business .
Well , imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company .
Imagine what a game changer that would be .
Well , there is only one way .
And yes , this is ambitious , but there is momentum on this issue , and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum , and it &apos;s just starting on this issue .
And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference .
Now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
And the techies among you , you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be .
The U.K. government is already on board ; it supports these public registries .
That is momentum .
America still needs to come on board , as do so many other countries .
Because this isn &apos;t just about changing the law , this is about starting a conversation about what it &apos;s okay for companies to do , and in what ways is it acceptable to use company structures .
This is a human issue which affects us all .
Global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
Let &apos;s just do it , let &apos;s end anonymous companies .
Chris Hadfield : What I learned from going blind in space
What &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
And why did you do it ?
You look back to the first five shuttle launches , the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine .
Not great odds , so it &apos;s a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you &apos;re going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you &apos;re either going to be floating effortlessly , gloriously in space , or you &apos;ll be dead .
And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad -- in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad , and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center , it &apos;s normally predawn , and in the distance , lit up by the huge xenon lights , is your spaceship -- the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet .
We ride the elevator up and we crawl in , on your hands and knees into the spaceship , one at a time , and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back .
In the astronaut business -- the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle ; it &apos;s the most complicated flying machine ever built .
And so you &apos;re very conscious in the cockpit ; you &apos;re thinking about all of the things that you might have to do , all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through .
And then about three and a half minutes before launch , the huge nozzles on the back , like the size of big church bells , swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle , like the vehicle is alive underneath you , like an elephant getting up off its knees or something .
And 15 seconds before launch , this happens : Voice : 12 , 11 , 10 , nine , eight , seven , six -- -- start , two , one , booster ignition , and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery , returning to the space station , paving the way ...
You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re in the jaws of some enormous dog and there &apos;s a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space , accelerating wildly straight up , shouldering your way through the air , and you &apos;re in a very complex place -- paying attention , watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face .
You get lighter and lighter , the force gets on us heavier and heavier .
Until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we &apos;re weightless .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
Why would you do something that dangerous ?
I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do .
But the real question is , how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it ?
And having the goal in mind , thinking about where it might lead , directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible , to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that &apos;s going around the world at five miles a second , eight kilometers a second , around the world 16 times a day , with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside .
And you see , because of the speed , a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year .
You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit , and you &apos;re going through space with the world .
And you &apos;re holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything , it &apos;s unfathomable blackness , with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into .
And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind , and I didn &apos;t know why .
I was thinking , what do I do next ?
But unfortunately , without gravity , tears don &apos;t fall .
So what &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
A lot of people are afraid of spiders .
And how do you know ?
But then you could say , well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not ?
So if you actually do the research , you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders , and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000 .
And that spider -- not only that , but that spider has beautiful markings on it , it &apos;s like &quot; I &apos;m dangerous . I got a big radiation symbol on my back , it &apos;s the black widow . &quot;
Spider webs like this , it doesn &apos;t build those , it builds them down in the corners .
So in fact , the next time you walk into a spiderweb , you don &apos;t need to panic and go with your caveman reaction .
How do you get around it , though ?
Well , next time you see a spiderweb , have a good look , make sure it &apos;s not a black widow spider , and then walk into it .
It &apos;s just a little bit of fluffy stuff . It &apos;s not a big deal .
And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior , your caveman reaction , and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb -- or into your grandma &apos;s attic or whatever , into your own basement .
If you &apos;re outside on a spacewalk and you &apos;re blinded , your natural reaction would be to panic , I think .
But we had considered all the venom , and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs .
And we don &apos;t just practice things going right , we practice things going wrong all the time , so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs .
So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
Instead you kind of look around and go , &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t see , but I can hear , I can talk , Scott Parazynski is out here with me .
We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue , so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to .
It &apos;s not nearly as big a deal .
We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside , Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes , and it turned out it was just the anti-fog , sort of a mixture of oil and soap , that got in my eye .
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
You can fundamentally change your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...
You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge , just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear .
It &apos;s time to come home at the end .
Three of us climb in , and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere .
The only part that survives is the little bullet that we &apos;re riding in , and it falls into the atmosphere , and in essence you are riding a meteorite home , and riding meteorites is scary , and it ought to be .
And in fact , you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth .
And when the great big parachute opened , we knew that if it didn &apos;t open there &apos;s a second parachute , and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism .
Reporter : And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters , once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi-8 helicopters .
CH : And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end , but you &apos;re ready for it you &apos;re in a custom-built seat , you know how the shock absorber works .
You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy , which were impossible and dauntingly scary , dauntingly terrifying , and put them into practice , and figured out a way to reprogram yourself , to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise .
I know this song , and it &apos;s really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself , but it &apos;s also , I think , a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe , we are people , and we &apos;re taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place .
That &apos;s very nice of you . Thank you very much .
Carin Bondar : The birds and the bees are just the beginning
Anyone in the room thought about sex today ?
Thank you for putting your hand up over there .
I &apos;m here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex .
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings .
Now invariably , you &apos;re probably thinking about what belongs to our own species , these very familiar structures , but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing .
So this is a paper nautilus .
Just what is a hectocotylus ?
It leaves the &#91; body of the male &#93; , finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water , attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm .
Now , the tapir is a mammal from South America .
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands .
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom , however , is not that of the tapir .
Mm-hm . So with all of this diversity in structure , one might think , then , that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction .
But of course , that doesn &apos;t exactly happen , and that &apos;s because we can &apos;t just take form into account .
And these contributions are far from equal .
Sperm , on the other hand , is abundant and cheap , so it makes more sense for males to have a more-sex-is-better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations .
I mean , if a female doesn &apos;t choose a particular male , or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough , then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things : avoiding predators , taking care of offspring , gathering and ingesting food .
This is bedbug sex , and it &apos;s aptly termed traumatic insemination .
They stab it anywhere in her body , and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries .
Now if you &apos;ve ever been out for a nice , peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex , you &apos;ve undoubtedly been alarmed , because it looks like gang rape .
A group of males will grab a female , hold her down , and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis into her corkscrew-shaped vagina over and over and over again .
Now the female actually gets the last laugh , though , because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries .
But orgasm didn &apos;t actually evolve until about 65 million years ago with the advent of mammals .
There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one &apos;s partner .
It &apos;s a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different .
So going back to our biological minds , then , we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages , because she can use her time for other things : avoiding predators , taking care of young , finding and ingesting food .
Why do they do this ?
Mm-hm .
Now males have been observed to prod the female &apos;s genital opening prior to copulating with her , and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum , P.I. hypothesis , females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches .
So we &apos;ve seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner .
We &apos;ve also seen a titillation strategy pleasing their female partners into choosing them Now unfortunately , in the animal kingdom , it &apos;s the coercion strategy that we see time and time again .
Now interestingly , there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn &apos;t allow for sexual coercion to take place .
So before a male can insert his penis into a female &apos;s vagina , she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside-out it in her own body .
It &apos;s simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action .
In hyena societies , adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale .
So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male , you take away all the social power he has .
Well , sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere .
So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals , including ourselves , spend a good amount of time thinking about sex , but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it .
Anne-Marie Slaughter : Can we all &quot; have it all &quot; ?
So my moment of truth did not come all at once .
This was my moment to lean in , to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs , and I had just finished a big , 18-month project for Secretary Clinton , successfully , and I knew I could handle a bigger job .
But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton , New Jersey , where my husband and my two teenage sons lived , and it was not going well .
But deep down , I knew that the right decision was to go home , even if I didn &apos;t fully recognize the woman who was making that choice .
I couldn &apos;t keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me .
Over the next year , while my family was righting itself , I started to realize that even if I could go back into government , I didn &apos;t want to .
I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me , not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want , and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed .
I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers , so that the measure of male-female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions : prime ministers , presidents , CEOs , directors , managers , Nobel laureates , leaders .
But that &apos;s only half of real equality , and I now think we &apos;re never going to get there unless we recognize the other half .
It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men .
In the workplace , real equality means valuing family just as much as work , and understanding that the two reinforce each other .
If you work for me , and you have a family issue , I expect you to attend to it , and I am confident , and my confidence has always been borne out , that the work will get done , and done better .
And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts .
He &apos;s much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high-speed , horizontal , networked global economy .
The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations , and a 2008 national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work , they &apos;re more satisfied and more loyal , they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health .
So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem .
Twenty years ago , when my family first started going to Italy , we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta .
It &apos;s actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch .
So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative .
Think about it : Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival .
Now most of you , when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving , instinctively translate those categories into men &apos;s work and women &apos;s work .
But consider a same-sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily .
They got married five years ago , and now they have two-year-old twins .
So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities ?
Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules ?
Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career ?
The same-sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women &apos;s problems , they &apos;re family problems .
Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need , and many of those workers are scrambling .
If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal , then why shouldn &apos;t a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy ?
Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains .
They routinely rank among the top 15 countries of the most globally competitive economies , but at the same time , they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index .
So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference , but we &apos;re not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture , and the kind of cultural change required means re-socializing men .
Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners , that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder .
It &apos;s certainly not complete .
We can decide to be a breadwinner , a caregiver , or any combination of the two .
His friends may praise his decision , but underneath , they &apos;re scratching their heads .
And as many women hold that view as men do .
A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner .
So as parents and partners , we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be , either caregivers or breadwinners .
I can almost hear lots of you thinking , &quot; No way . &quot;
At least in the United States , lots of men take pride in cooking , and frankly obsess over stoves .
They take paternity leave when they can .
Indeed , there are male college students now who are starting to say , &quot; I want to be a stay-at-home dad . &quot;
And in Norway , where men have an automatic three month &apos;s paternity leave , but they lose it if they decide not to take it , a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn &apos;t in fact take their leave when they had kids .
So I was raised to believe that championing women &apos;s rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top .
But I &apos;ve come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work , and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do .
It turns out that &quot; you don &apos;t care &quot; is just as much a part of who we are as &quot; that &apos;s not fair . &quot;
He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others .
Let &apos;s make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution .
You may think that can &apos;t happen , but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties , where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms , and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual .
The revolution for human equality can happen .
It will happen .
Thank you .
While working with kids who have trouble speaking , Ajit Narayanan sketched out a way to think about language in pictures , to relate words and concepts in &quot; maps . &quot; The idea now powers an app that helps nonverbal people communicate , and the big idea behind it , a language concept called FreeSpeech , has exciting potential .
Specifically , I make technologies to help them communicate .
And because of this , they have a lot of difficulty with language .
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup .
These are two other pictures of soup , but you can see that these are more abstract And when you get to language , you see that it becomes a word whose look , the way it looks and the way it sounds , has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with , or what it represents , which is the bowl of soup .
Now that &apos;s why most of the people that work with children with autism -- speech therapists , educators -- what they do is , they try to help children with autism communicate not with words , but with pictures .
And this has been incredibly effective ; for the last 30 , 40 years people have been doing this .
These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences , and these sentences are spoken out .
Now , this was very effective .
And I realized something interesting : Avaz helps children with autism learn words .
Let me explain this in a little more detail .
Now it &apos;s not just the words here that convey the meaning .
And that &apos;s why a sentence like &quot; I want soup tonight &quot; is different from a sentence like &quot; Soup want I tonight , &quot; which is completely meaningless .
Now , this is what we call grammar .
in order to convey anything you want to .
The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective .
Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions .
You want to eat ? Somebody else wants to eat ?
And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible .
And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for .
And so if you do this , then what you &apos;re conveying is not a sentence in English , but what you &apos;re conveying is really a meaning , Now , meaning is really the underbelly , in some sense , of language .
And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form .
And I found that this is not enough .
something like negation , you want to say , &quot; I don &apos;t want soup , &quot; then you can &apos;t do that by asking a question .
Again , if you wanted to say , &quot; I wanted soup yesterday , &quot; you do that by converting the word &quot; want &quot; into &quot; wanted . &quot;
So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete .
Let me show you this with a different example . Let &apos;s take this sentence : &quot; I told the carpenter I could not pay him . &quot;
The way that this particular system works , you can start with any part of this sentence .
So this is the word &quot; tell . &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask questions .
I told whom ? I told the carpenter .
Then we make it &quot; can &apos;t pay , &quot; and we can make it &quot; couldn &apos;t pay &quot; So who couldn &apos;t pay ? I couldn &apos;t pay .
And then you join these two together by asking this question : What did I tell the carpenter ?
Now think about this . This is — — this is a representation of this sentence without language .
First of all , I could have started anywhere .
I could have started anywhere in the sentence , The second thing is , if I wasn &apos;t an English speaker , if I was speaking in some other language , this map would actually hold true in any language .
I was trying out so many different combinations of this .
I was trying to convert language , convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech , and vice versa , and back and forth .
So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English .
And by putting these two pieces together , the representation and the engine , I was able to create an app , a technology for children with autism , that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar .
And I had an idea , and I want to talk to you about this idea next . In about 1997 , about 15 years back , there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language , and they found something very interesting .
Now I don &apos;t know why that &apos;s the case , but my guess is that that &apos;s because when you learn a language as an adult , you almost invariably learn it through your native language , or through your first language .
And so this gave me this idea .
And so I tried a number of experiments .
And I built an app out of it , a game out of it , in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement , a sound reinforcement of visual structures , they &apos;re able to learn language .
All right , let &apos;s talk about something else .
So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us .
Why is it one-dimensional ? It &apos;s one-dimensional because it &apos;s sound .
Our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound .
I mean , we have these rich , complicated , multi-dimensional ideas .
Now what &apos;s interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
Google trawls all these countless billions of websites , all of which are in English , and when you want to use Google , you go into Google search , and you type in English , and it matches the English with the English .
I have a suspicion that if we did this , we &apos;d find that algorithms like searching , like retrieval , all of these things , are much simpler and also more effective , because they don &apos;t process the data structure of speech .
The data structure of thought .
But let &apos;s look at this in a little more detail .
We have the Free Speech representation on one side , and we have the FreeSpeech Engine , which generates English .
It doesn &apos;t have any specific information in it which is about English .
That &apos;s a pretty interesting concept in itself .
it &apos;s actually not very complicated .
And that gives this interesting idea .
And that gives another interesting idea .
I could create content in one language , FreeSpeech , and the person who &apos;s consuming that content , the person who &apos;s reading that particular information could choose any engine , and they could read it in their own mother tongue , in their native language .
We have so many different languages .
That means &quot; ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most beautiful of human creations .
It entertains , it educates , it enlightens , but what I like the most about language is that it empowers . I want to leave you with this .
The girl &apos;s name is Pavna , and that &apos;s her mother , Kalpana .
She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy , so ever since she was born , she could neither move nor talk .
Daniel Webster said this : He said , &quot; If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception , I would choose to keep the power of communication , for with it , I would regain all the rest . &quot;
Thank you .
Henry Lin : What we can learn from galaxies far , far away
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
So , how big ?
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
So that was very big .
Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas -- in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
You were lied to .
Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
And dark matter is no exception .
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
And we need a way to simplify it .
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
He had this to say : &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot;
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .
An idea permeates our modern view of relationships : that men and women have always paired off in sexually exclusive relationships . But before the dawn of agriculture , humans may actually have been quite promiscuous . Author Christopher Ryan walks us through the controversial evidence that human beings are sexual omnivores by nature , in hopes that a more nuanced understanding may put an end to discrimination , shame and the kind of unrealistic expectations that kill relationships .
All right . Are you with me ? Yeah . Yeah . All right .
Could be the neighbors , hotel room , your parents . Sorry .
Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman .
It doesn &apos;t count if it was you , sir .
Sitting next to a loud guy .
It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex , and it &apos;s generally the woman who makes more noise .
I wasn &apos;t even going to mention this , but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here , and she is the world &apos;s most famous female copulatory vocalizer .
We &apos;ll get back to that a little bit later .
We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant , as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books .
So we &apos;re extremely closely related to them , and as you &apos;ll see in terms of our behavior , we &apos;ve got some relationship as well .
Now , since Darwin &apos;s day there &apos;s been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution , and you &apos;re all familiar with it , even if you haven &apos;t read this stuff .
Generally we &apos;re talking about meat , shelter , status , protection , things like that .
Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship .
What Cacilda and I have argued is that no , this economic relationship , this oppositional relationship , is actually an artifact of agriculture , which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest .
So before agriculture , before the agricultural revolution , it &apos;s important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they &apos;re found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism .
Now I &apos;m not saying that our ancestors were noble savages , and I &apos;m not saying modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either .
And there &apos;s really no argument about this among anthropologists .
So we &apos;ve argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved , until agriculture , as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex , flexible social systems , networks , that our ancestors were very good at , and that &apos;s why our species has survived so well .
There were no strangers . Right ?
So I &apos;m saying , yes , there were overlapping sexual relationships , that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives .
I &apos;m not saying that they didn &apos;t love the people they were having sex with .
I &apos;m just saying it wasn &apos;t sexually exclusive .
What I &apos;m saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism .
Okay ? So this is my point .
Now , in addition to being a great genius , a wonderful man , a wonderful husband , a wonderful father , Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude .
So he couldn &apos;t understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond , right ?
Interestingly , chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent , roughly , of their menstrual cycle , bonobos 90 percent , and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle , whether she &apos;s menstruating , whether she &apos;s post-menopausal , whether she &apos;s already pregnant .
So it &apos;s a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
So what we &apos;re talking about is sperm competition .
The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men &apos;s sperm or just their own .
The one thing I &apos;ll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human .
Just look at the numbers .
If that number seems high for some of you , I assure you it seems low for others in the room .
the gorilla , the orangutan and the gibbon , who are more typical of mammals , having sex only about a dozen times per birth .
And you &apos;ll see that the human , chimp and bonobo all have external testicles , which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer .
That &apos;s what the external testicles are .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
Now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution .
In their society , everyone , men and women , are completely sexually autonomous .
Women have hundreds of partners .
When the woman becomes pregnant , the child is cared for by her , her sisters , and her brothers .
On the other side of the planet , in the Amazon , we &apos;ve got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity .
So a woman who wants to have a child who &apos;s smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy , the funny guy and the strong guy , to get the essence of each of these men into the baby , and then when the child is born , these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child .
So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book .
Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation .
The contradictions between what we &apos;re told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering .
Thank you .
We all have closets we have to come out of . Right ?
It &apos;s time we moved beyond Mars and Venus , because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa .
Thank you . Christopher Ryan : Thank you .
It &apos;s so perplexing , trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today .
Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism , but it &apos;s not who you are .
CR : Well first of all , the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable .
Certainly , you know , lots of people say to me , just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn &apos;t mean we should live that way now , and I agree with that .
But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories .
I think it was Schopenhauer who said , a person can do what they want but not want what they want .
It &apos;s the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people , there &apos;s something wrong with you , there &apos;s something wrong with your marriage , something wrong with your partner .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get at .
CR : Thank you , Chris .
What does it take to regrow bone in mass quantities ? Typical bone regeneration -- wherein bone is taken from a patient &apos;s hip and grafted onto damaged bone elsewhere in the body -- is limited and can cause great pain just a few years after operation . In an informative talk , Molly Stevens introduces a new stem cell application that harnesses bone &apos;s innate ability to regenerate and produces vast quantities of bone tissue painlessly .
Whatever life throws at us , whether it &apos;s cancer , diabetes , heart disease , or even broken bones , we want to try and get better .
Take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
We &apos;re not quite sure why they did it .
But it also had other very nice properties .
And I think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology .
They &apos;ve taken things off the shelf .
And during World War II , what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions , and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye , but the very interesting thing about it was that material , actually , wasn &apos;t causing any inflammatory response .
And this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses .
And that example , I think , is a really nice one , because it helps remind us that in the early days , people often chose materials because they were bioinert .
You &apos;d put them in the body and you wouldn &apos;t get an adverse response .
We &apos;re actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive , that will interact with the body , and that furthermore we can put in the body , they &apos;ll have their function , and then they &apos;ll dissolve away over time .
We have cells there , typically from the patient .
And this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
And if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world , in all the different labs in the world , there &apos;s pretty much every tissue you can think of .
Our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate , and here we see poor Prometheus , who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods .
But of course his liver would regenerate every day , and so day after day he was punished for eternity by the gods .
So it &apos;s going to be very different from tissue to tissue .
And bone is actually quite good at repairing .
And one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here , called an iliac crest harvest .
And it actually works really well , because it &apos;s your own bone , and it &apos;s well vascularized , which means it &apos;s got a really good blood supply .
So what we were thinking is , there &apos;s a tremendous need for bone repair , of course , but this iliac crest-type approach really has a lot of limitations to it , and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very , very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest ?
And we simplified it a lot , so we got rid of a lot of these steps .
And what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple , but because we used it in a really clever way , we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach .
And it &apos;s an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor , and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach .
So what we do is , in humans , we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones .
And that layer is actually normally very , very tightly bound to the underlying bone , and it &apos;s got stem cells in it .
So we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then , within 30 seconds , would turn into quite a rigid gel and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone .
And we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in , and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells , and they can form lots of new tissue , and then over time , you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body .
So in this picture , you can see the middle of the leg , so the bone marrow , then you can see the original bone , and you can see where that original bone finishes , and just to the left of that is the new bone that &apos;s grown within that bioreactor cavity , and you can actually make it even larger .
So it &apos;s very , very low in terms of after-pain compared to an iliac crest harvest .
Now , at the time that we did this , this received a lot of attention in the press , because it was a really nice way of generating new bone , and we got many , many contacts from different people that were interested in using this .
And so you do get these kinds of contacts , and of course , being British and also growing up in France , I tend to be very blunt , and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case , there probably wasn &apos;t that much in there to protect in the first place .
And actually we know that those cells in the body , in the embryo , as they develop can form a different kind of tissue , cartilage , and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry , put it in there , and we were able to get 100 percent cartilage instead .
So for other kinds of operations , there &apos;s definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches .
And so our team has chemists , it has cell biologists , surgeons , physicists even , and those people all come together and we think really hard about designing the materials .
And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body .
We &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
And if we zoom in again , actually in the case of bone , the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale , and it &apos;s a hybrid material that &apos;s part organic , part inorganic .
And so I &apos;m showing here just two examples where we &apos;ve made some materials that have that sort of structure , and you can really tailor it .
And an inorganic material would normally be really brittle , and you wouldn &apos;t be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it .
But the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells , and so even though it &apos;s 3D , the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface , and that &apos;s a little bit unnatural .
And there &apos;s a lot of work going on in both of these areas .
And one of the things that we know is that , unfortunately , if you have a heart attack , then that tissue can start to die , and your outcome may not be very good over time .
And there &apos;s lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide , and they use many different types of cells , but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually , very often , those cells will die once you &apos;ve implanted them .
And so some of the things that we &apos;re thinking of , and many other people in the field are thinking of , are actually developing materials for that .
We still need chemistry , we still need mechanics , we still need really interesting topography , and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells .
You can see them now beating synchronously on these materials , and that &apos;s a very , very exciting development that &apos;s going on .
And so for that , I &apos;d like to thank all of you as well .
Rupal Patel : Synthetic voices , as unique as fingerprints
I &apos;d like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are : our voice .
In the words of the poet Longfellow , &quot; the human voice is the organ of the soul . &quot;
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Stephen Hawking : &quot; I would have thought it was fairly obvious what I meant . &quot;
What you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition .
In the U.S. alone , there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak , and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate .
This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago , and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices , different devices , but the same voice .
We wouldn &apos;t dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man .
It really struck me , and I wanted to do something about this .
I want you to take a listen to how they sound .
You probably didn &apos;t understand what they said , but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities .
So I reached out to my collaborator , Tim Bunnell .
These are people who had lost their voice later in life .
But I thought , there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over .
We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation , to create custom-crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities .
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it , I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson . Okay ?
Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults .
Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source , which is the vibrations generated by your voice box , which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract .
So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech .
Now I told you earlier that I &apos;d spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder , and what I &apos;ve found is that even though their filters were impaired , they were able to modulate their source : the pitch , the loudness , the tempo of their voice .
So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity , I had this idea .
Because when we mix them , we can get a voice that &apos;s as clear as our surrogate talker -- that &apos;s the person we borrowed the filter from — and is similar in identity to our target talker .
That &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
Well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances .
Voice : Things happen in pairs .
The sky is blue without clouds .
The more speech you have , the better sounding voice you &apos;re going to have .
We &apos;re going to call this database a voice bank .
Voice : I love chocolate .
It &apos;s called concatenative synthesis , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re using .
What &apos;s novel is how we make it sound like this young woman .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds , but that &apos;s enough for us to extract her source characteristics .
She calls it mixing colors to paint voices .
Samantha &apos;s voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this .
RP : So now , Samantha can say this .
I can &apos;t wait to use my new voice with my friends .
Now there &apos;s millions of people around the world like Samantha , millions , and we &apos;ve only begun to scratch the surface .
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
For Samantha , her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest , a stranger who gave her the gift of voice .
What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level .
To do that as a first step , we &apos;ve put together this website , VocaliD.org , as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors , as expertise donors , in whatever way to make this vision a reality .
Well , giving your voice can change lives .
So that &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
About five years ago , we built our very first voice for a little boy named William .
And then I saw William typing a message on his device .
Imagine carrying around someone else &apos;s voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice .
This is what William said : &quot; Never heard me before . &quot;
Chris McKnett : The investment logic for sustainability
The world is changing in some really profound ways , and I worry that investors aren &apos;t paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change , especially when it comes to sustainability .
I think it &apos;s reckless to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns .
I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think , better-performing than you believe , and more important than we can imagine .
We have a population that &apos;s both growing and aging ; we have seven billion souls today heading to 10 billion at the end of the century ; we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished ; and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing .
They &apos;re economic issues , and that makes them relevant to risk and return .
Resist this , if you can . Don &apos;t do this at home .
We know that investors , when they look at a company and decide whether to invest , they look at financial data , metrics like sales growth , cash flow , market share , valuation -- you know , the really sexy stuff .
Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG : environment , social and governance .
Social includes human capital , things like employee engagement and innovation capacity , as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights .
See , I told you this is the really juicy stuff .
It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet , and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes .
Well , the really cool thing is that most CEOs are .
About 80 percent of global CEOs see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries .
So the views of CEOs are clear .
So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results ?
In 2012 , State Street migrated 54 applications to the cloud environment , and we retired another 85 .
Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace , and they reduce our real estate footprint , and they yield savings of 23 million dollars in operating costs annually , and avoid the emissions of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon .
So awesome , right ?
Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate , and about a decade ago , they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business .
Well , with apologies to the Home Improvement fans , there &apos;s more growth in water than in power tools , and this company has their sights set on what they call &quot; the new New World . &quot;
Now , you may be asking yourself , are these just isolated cases ?
Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially ?
The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others .
It &apos;s an index of large companies from developed markets across the world .
Over three plus years , no performance tradeoff .
In some cases , there may be outperformance from ESG .
Now over almost eight years , they &apos;ve outperformed by about two thirds .
But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns .
Are investors , particularly institutional investors , Well , some are , and a few are really at the vanguard .
Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia , with assets of 22 billion &#91; dollars &#93; .
You gotta love the Aussies , right ?
CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California , and with assets of 244 billion &#91; dollars &#93; , they are the second largest in the U.S.
Now , they &apos;re moving toward 100 percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund .
In their own words , &quot; long-term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital : financial , human , and physical .
Now , I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job , and not all of them see it this way .
The one that just really gets under my skin is , &quot; If you want to do something about that , just make money , give the profits to charities . &quot;
Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet .
They &apos;re compatible .
But institutional investors are the x-factor in sustainability .
The answer , quite simply , is , they have the money .
I mean , a really lot of it .
The global bond market , 78 trillion .
That &apos;s eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
That &apos;s some serious freaking firepower .
What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them ?
What if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
Well , President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on : &quot; There are risks and costs to a program of action , but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction . &quot;
Well , maybe not if you live in Boston . But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen , right ?
We &apos;re creating insurance , reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy , and at the same time , in the short term , we &apos;re not sacrificing performance .
I bet you can &apos;t guess which side I &apos;m on .
Thank you .
In this charming talk , artist Aparna Rao shows us her latest work : cool , cartoony sculptures that play with your perception -- and crave your attention . Take a few minutes to simply be delighted .
Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
So here &apos;s a video .
But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
The next work is Decoy .
It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
So here is the first test scenario .
But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
It could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
And here is a prototype .
Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
Thank you .
As the world &apos;s cities undergo explosive growth , inequality is intensifying . Wealthy neighborhoods and impoverished slums grow side by side , the gap between them widening . In this eye-opening talk , architect Teddy Cruz asks us to rethink urban development from the bottom up . Sharing lessons from the slums of Tijuana , Cruz explores the creative intelligence of the city &apos;s residents and offers a fresh perspective on what we can learn from places of scarcity .
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today &apos;s urban crisis .
It &apos;s particularly a cultural crisis , a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing , unable to challenge the oil-hungry , selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption , from southern California to New York to Dubai .
And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity , as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana-San Diego border region , which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect .
In this border region , we find some of the wealthiest real estate , as I once found in the edges of San Diego , barely 20 minutes away from some of the poorest settlements in Latin America .
So I &apos;ve been arguing in the last years that , in fact , the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability , that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization .
I &apos;m really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
So I &apos;ve been interested as an artist in the measuring , the observation , of many of the trans-border informal flows across this border : in one direction , from south to north , the flow of immigrants into the United States , and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana .
So these are houses waiting to cross the border .
This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice .
Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls .
They have figured out how to peel off the tire , how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall .
So while , as an architect , this is a very compelling thing to witness , this creative intelligence , I also want to keep myself in check .
I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness , that informality here , the informal , is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists , that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs .
They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
And I &apos;m talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on steroids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new , inclusive and more equitable land use policies .
So these action neighborhoods , as I call them , really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do , in fact , with belonging to the nation-state , and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city .
This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night , a few months ago , decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park .
Two weeks later , the police stopped them .
The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space .
Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway , so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them .
They were also lucky , they said , because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
With this knowledge , these teenagers as skaters confronted the city .
The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO , and of course they didn &apos;t know what an NGO was .
And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise , to organize budgets , to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city , expanding it to other categories .
Now for many of you , this story might seem trivial or naive .
They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border , they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool , because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city .
Now this journey from the bottom-up to the transformation of the top-down is where I find hope today .
It is , in fact , this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city .
Thank you .
Maya Penn started her first company when she was 8 years old , and thinks deeply about how to be responsible both to her customers and to the planet . She shares her story -- and some animations , and some designs , and some infectious energy -- in this charming talk .
Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
Customer : I &apos;d like a RAM sandwich and a glass of your finest Code 39 .
Our special is tracking cookie .
Server : Coming right up , sir .
Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; Malicious Dishes . &quot;
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
I built my first website myself in HTML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
Ideas can spark a movement .
Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &amp; amp ; quot ; This could be a scarf or a hat , &amp; amp ; quot ; and I had all these ideas for designs .
And I thought , I can start my own business .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
Thank you . Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
Nicolas Perony : Puppies ! Now that I &apos;ve got your attention , complexity theory
Science , science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe , which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote , and yet much , much closer , much more directly related to us , there are many things we don &apos;t really understand .
But first , what do we call complexity ?
Well , complex is not complicated .
On the opposite , a complex system is made of many , many similar parts , and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior .
The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only .
But from Aristotle , let &apos;s move onto a more concrete example of complex systems .
In the beginning , the system is disorganized .
Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
So it &apos;s all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges .
We collect data on animal populations , analyze complex patterns , try to explain them .
So again , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts .
And you may be asking yourself which side I &apos;m on , biology or physics ?
When I was a child , I loved to build stuff , to create complicated machines .
It was very , very complicated , but it worked beautifully in our test room , and on demo day , professors had assembled to grade the project .
It turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
At the first bend in the line , it left its course , and crashed into a wall .
That &apos;s when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine , the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected .
I wanted to understand complexity , the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom .
Bechstein &apos;s bats are a common species of European bats .
Mostly they roost , or sleep , together .
So I study roosting associations in bats , and this is what it looks like .
It could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
In this network , all the circles are nodes , individual bats , and the lines between them are social bonds , associations between individuals .
This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission-fusion dynamics .
Even more interesting , in fact : Every year , around October , the colony splits up , and all bats hibernate separately , but year after year , when the bats come together again in the spring , the communities stay the same .
With a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , We didn &apos;t know that was possible .
So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex , stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities ?
To understand this system , we built a computer model of roosting , based on simple , individual rules , and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony .
What the model told us is that , in a nutshell , each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends , and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them .
This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats .
Between 2010 and 2011 , the colony lost more than two thirds of its members , probably due to the very cold winter .
Instead , it formed a single , cohesive social unit , which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years .
All they do is follow simple association rules , and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure .
Now I want to tell you another story , but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa .
I &apos;m sure you know meerkats .
They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together , and what this has to do with their social structure .
In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road .
But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another .
We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road , but when it comes to crossing it , crossing the road , she gives way to the subordinates , a manner of saying , &quot; Go ahead , tell me if it &apos;s safe . &quot;
So I built a model , a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road .
Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment .
When these particles get to the road , they sense some kind of obstacle , and they bounce against it .
George Box , who was an English statistician , once wrote , &quot; All models are false , but some models are useful . &quot;
But it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species .
In fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
They adapt very simple rules , and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat .
My message here -- and it &apos;s not a complicated one , but a simple one of wonder and hope -- my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity , and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment .
Thank you .
Nicolas Perony : I &apos;m okay , thanks .
You brought some examples : The females are the social ones , the females are the dominant ones , I &apos;m not sure who thinks how .
Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species ?
For examples , in sea horses or in koalas , in fact , it is the males who take care of the young always .
So that &apos;s it .
Thank you , Nicolas Perony .
McKenna Pope &apos;s younger brother loved to cook , but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven -- because it was a toy for girls . So at age 13 , Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing . In a heartening talk , Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless .
So allow me to tell you about it .
When this whole shebang happened , he was four .
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these , needless to say , uneatable concoctions , or making invisible macaroni and cheese .
And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy-Bake Oven . Right ?
And he wanted one so badly .
In the commercials , and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens , Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys aren &apos;t .
He thought that he wasn &apos;t supposed to want to be a chef , because that was something that girls did .
And this got me thinking , God , I wish there was a way that I could change this , that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it .
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through Facebook , through Twitter , through YouTube , through Reddit , through Tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
So this petition started to take off -- humongously fast , you have no idea .
In three weeks , maybe three and a half , I had 46,000 signatures on this petition .
So , needless to say , it was crazy .
It was literally one of the best moments of my life .
What I didn &apos;t realize at the time , however , was that I had become an activist , I could change something , that even as a kid , or maybe even especially as a kid , my voice mattered , and your voice matters too .
People online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
So , let &apos;s see .
How about from Whiteboy77AGS : &quot; People always need something to about . &quot;
It hurt me , and it made me think , what &apos;s the point of making change in the future ?
Haters gonna hate .
So let your haters hate , you know what , and make your change , because I know you can .
And you can make that change .
And that spark that you &apos;ve been hearing about all day today , and turn it into a fire .
Anant Agarwal : Why massive open online courses matter
I &apos;d like to reimagine education .
It starts with an M.
Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
Now , in this discussion today , I &apos;m going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs .
So , here &apos;s a classroom at this little three-letter institute in the Northeast of America , MIT .
What &apos;s changed ?
Whoop-de-do .
The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks .
You know , from healthcare to transportation , everything is different , but education hasn &apos;t changed .
So what you see here is not a rock concert .
This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria .
Now , I really believe that we can transform education , both in quality and scale and access , through technology .
Given education has been calcified for 500 years , we really cannot think about reengineering it , We really have to completely reimagine it .
Even the infrastructure has to change .
We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises , online videos .
We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
So at edX and a number of other organizations , we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education .
And we had no marketing budget .
This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its 150-year history .
7,200 is also a big number .
Now these large numbers are just one part of the story .
But before I go into that , let me tell you a story .
I call it teen-lish .
It &apos;s got two sounds : a grunt and a silence .
&quot; Hmm . &quot;
Silence . &quot; Can you listen to me ? &quot;
I texted her . I got an instant response .
So I texted her again . Boom , another response .
And so since then , our life has changed .
It &apos;s just been absolutely great .
Now , I &apos;m older , and my youthful looks might belie that , but I &apos;m not in the millennial generation .
The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology .
Let &apos;s not fight it . Let &apos;s embrace it .
But what if we embraced technology , embraced the millennial generation &apos;s natural predilections , and really think about creating these online technologies , blend them into their lives .
So rather than driving our kids into a classroom , herding them out there at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning -- I hated going to class at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , so why are we forcing our kids to do that ?
Then they come into the classroom for some in-person interaction . They can have discussions amongst themselves .
They can work with the professor In fact , with edX , when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world , this was happening unbeknownst to us .
And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog .
So we did a pilot experimental blended courses , working with San Jose State University in California , again , with the circuits and electronics course .
the instructors flipped the classroom , blended online and in person , and the results were staggering .
Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more , but the early results are incredible .
With this blended class late last year , the failure rate fell to nine percent .
Now before we go too far into this , I &apos;d like to spend some time discussing some key ideas .
One idea is active learning .
Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises .
Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education .
And this is a form of learning called active learning , and really promoted by a very early paper , in 1972 , by Craik and Lockhart , where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing .
The second idea is self-pacing .
I wasn &apos;t all that smart , and I would be scrambling , taking notes , and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour .
They can hit the pause button .
Heck , they can even mute the professor .
The third idea that we have is instant feedback .
I mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
And we &apos;ve all submitted homeworks , and your grades come back two weeks later , you &apos;ve forgotten all about it .
Some are never graded .
If they get it wrong , they can get instant feedback .
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark .
My colleague Ed Bertschinger , who heads up the physics department at MIT , has this to say about instant feedback : He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes .
You know , all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on .
So we applied these gamification techniques to learning , and we can build these online laboratories .
So as this little video shows here , you can engage students So here , the learners are building a circuit with Lego-like ease .
Fifth is peer learning .
Let me tell you a story .
I told my TAs , okay , 24 / 7 , we &apos;re going to be up monitoring the forum , answering questions .
How do you do that for 150,000 ?
had popped in with a different answer .
And all I had to do was go and bless it , &quot; Good answer . &quot;
Now this is all not just in the future .
So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world , from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California -- And these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities , and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs , where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next-generation textbook .
Finally , I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit .
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces .
The Aakash is 40 dollars .
But I think at the end of the day , I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities .
Thank you .
Yves Morieux : As work gets more complex , 6 rules to simplify
I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas : Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work ?
Despite all the technological advances -- computers , I.T. , communications , telecommunications , the Internet .
Why do people feel so miserable , even actively disengaged ?
Acting against the interest of their company .
At the beginning , I thought there was a chicken and egg issue : Because people are less engaged , they are less productive .
But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .
The hard -- structure , processes , systems .
And whenever a company reorganizes , restructures , reengineers , goes through a cultural transformation program , it chooses these two pillars .
The real issue is -- and this is the answer to the two enigmas -- these pillars are obsolete .
They are obsolete .
The hard approach , basically is that you start from strategy , requirements , structures , processes , systems , KPIs , scorecards , committees , headquarters , hubs , clusters , you name it .
What happens basically on the left , you have more complexity , the new complexity of business .
And every time there is a new requirement , we use the same approach .
The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization .
An automotive company , the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix .
You have Mr. Noise , Mr. Petrol Consumption , Mr. Anti-Collision Properties .
What happens when the new requirement emerges ?
So therefore the new requirement is repairability , making cars easy to repair .
So , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
And Mr. Repairability creates the repairability process .
That came on top of 25 other KPIs .
Twenty percent at most , divided by 26 KPIs , repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent .
But what occurs for zero impact ? Mr. Repairability , process , scorecard , evaluation , coordination with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact .
It is basically the interplay .
The connections , the interactions , the synapses .
You know , you could call it cooperation , basically .
You know , the repairability issue is a cooperation problem .
When we don &apos;t cooperate we need more time , more equipment , more systems , more teams .
Who will pay for that ?
No , they will refuse .
Stress , burnout , they are overwhelmed , accidents .
How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation ?
They create a middle office .
Instead of one problem between the back and the front , now I have two problems .
Plus I have to pay for the middle office .
It can only add new boxes , new bones in the skeleton .
Improve interpersonal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
It is even counterproductive .
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife .
And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife .
The more we like each other , the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs .
Definitely , these approaches are obsolete .
Simple rule number one : Understand what others do .
We need to go beyond the boxes , the job descriptions , beyond the surface of the container , to understand the real content .
Second , you need to reenforce integrators .
How can you reinforce your managers as integrators ?
When there are too many layers people are too far from the action , therefore they need KPIs , metrics , they need poor proxies for reality .
By removing rules -- the bigger we are , the more we need integrators , therefore the less rules we must have , to give discretionary power to managers .
And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules .
You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate , to move out of insulation .
These rules , they come from game theory and organizational sociology .
Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions .
They said to the design engineers : Now , in three years , when the new car is launched on the market , you will move to the after sales network , and become in charge of the warranty budget , and if the warranty budget explodes , it will explode in your face . Much more powerful than 0.8 percent variable compensation .
When you remove these buffers , you hold me by the nose , I hold you by the ear .
Remove the second TV .
You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don &apos;t cooperate .
He says , blame is not for failure , it is for failing to help or ask for help .
Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses , my real forecast , because I know I will not be blamed if I fail , but if I fail to help or ask for help .
You stop drawing boxes , dotted lines , full lines ; you look at their interplay .
On human resource management practices .
You create more value with lower cost .
Complicatedness : This is your battle , business leaders .
This is rubbish , very abstract .
The real battle is against ourselves , against our bureaucracy , our complicatedness .
Thank you .
What kind of robots does an animator / jazz musician / roboticist make ? Playful , reactive , curious ones . Guy Hoffman shows demo film of his family of unusual robots -- including two musical bots that like to jam with humans .
But this story doesn &apos;t start with robotics at all , it starts with animation .
I mean , look at them -- at the end of this movie , you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture .
So I made a really bad career decision .
I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation .
I &apos;m not using this phrase metaphorically , the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room .
As kind of like a backdrop to show how bad things are .
And I learned two surprising lessons -- one of them was that when you want to arouse emotions , it doesn &apos;t matter so much how something looks , it &apos;s all in the motion -- it &apos;s in the timing of how the thing moves .
He actually did the weasel in Ice Age .
So , if you want to find the right motion for a character , don &apos;t think about it , go use your body to find it -- stand in front of a mirror , act it out in front of a camera -- whatever you need .
A year later I found myself at MIT in the robotic life group , it was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots .
But I found that robots didn &apos;t move at all in this engaging way that I was used to for my animation studies .
And I thought , what if I took whatever I learned in animation school , and used that to design my robotic desk lamp .
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop .
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light , and more of a helpful , kind of quiet apprentice that &apos;s always there when you need it and doesn &apos;t really interfere .
So you can see my confusion here .
And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can at one point , just by the way it moves seem gentle and caring -- and in the other case , seem violent and confrontational .
Actor : &quot; You want to know something ? Well , you want to know something ?
Just laying there , eyes glazed over ! &quot;
I was at the time doing my Ph.D. , I was working on human robot teamwork ; teams of humans and robots working together .
And at the same time I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation with a good friend of mine who is actually here .
It was after a Passover seder .
Everybody did their own part .
We didn &apos;t have to communicate verbally about this .
And I thought , humans and robots don &apos;t look at all like this .
The human does a thing , the robot analyzes whatever the human did , then the robot decides what to do next , plans it and does it .
So , it &apos;s much more like a chess game and that makes sense because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists .
But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player , and more like a doer that just clicks and works together .
I took off from a Ph.D. I went to acting classes .
And I got every book I could find about acting , including one from the 19th century that I got from the library .
And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express .
It became very popular in the 20th century .
Instead you have to use your body to find the right movement .
Improvise , play off yor scene partner .
Which also talks about the same ideas -- We use our bodies to think , we don &apos;t just think with our brains and use our bodies to move .
And it was like a lightning bolt .
I wrote this paper -- which I never really published called &quot; Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence . &quot;
That &apos;s what you saw before with the actors .
Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates .
Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence , to try to match my movements as closely as possible , sort of like a game .
You can see when I psych it out , it gets fooled .
And then , I did another experiment , and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp , and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence .
The robot is the same lamp that you saw , and I put in it two brains .
It waits for its turn , it analyzes everything , it plans .
The other got more the stage actor , risk taker brain .
It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes and they had to work together .
And what I found was that people actually loved the adventurous robot .
They even called it &apos; he &apos; and &apos; she , &apos; whereas people with the calculated brain called it &apos; it . &apos; And nobody ever called it &apos; he &apos; or &apos; she &apos; .
Whatever that means .
Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice .
Which is almost what people expect robots to do , so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots , than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing .
Maybe it &apos;s time for robots to have the same kind of revolution .
And I thought , music , that &apos;s the perfect place to look at teamwork , coordination , timing , improvisation -- and we just got this robot playing marimba .
And , when I was looking at this , I looked at other works in human-robot improvisation -- yes , there are other works in human-robot improvisation -- and they were also a little bit like a chess game .
So , this is what musicians called a call and response interaction , and it also fits very well , robots and artificial intelligence .
Everybody &apos;s riffing off each other , nobody is stopping it for a moment .
It just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play , And does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me .
And so I tried to make a robot that doesn &apos;t actually know what it &apos;s doing , but it &apos;s still doing it .
Where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises .
And at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with .
Musicians also communicate with their bodies , with other band members , with the audience , they use their bodies to express the music .
And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot .
These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta , that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home . So I spent , I would say on average , three to four hours a day there .
To sort of show that it doesn &apos;t like what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat it &apos;s feeling at the moment .
I &apos;m going to show you now the same kind of performance , this time with a socially expressive head .
We &apos;re also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it &apos;s doing .
Now it &apos;s looking at me to make sure I &apos;m listening .
And when it &apos;s ready to coordinate the final chord with me .
And at some point , we are in Atlanta , so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point .
And here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat and -- notice two things . One , how irresistible it is to join the robot while it &apos;s moving its head .
And second , even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone , as soon as the robot turns to him , he turns back .
And the reason is that we can &apos;t ignore physical things moving in our environment .
So , if you have a problem with maybe your partners looking at the iPhone too much or their smartphone too much , you might want to have a robot there to get their attention . Just to introduce the last robot that we &apos;ve worked on , that came out of something kind of surprising that we found : At some point people didn &apos;t care anymore about the robot being so intelligent , and can improvise and listen , and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years on developing .
And we thought , why don &apos;t we take this idea , and I designed a new piece of furniture .
It was one of those things you plug your smartphone in .
So , a lot of bobbing head .
And it &apos;s not just fun and games .
Somewhere in your future there &apos;s going to be a robot in your life .
And I want these robots to be -- to be more fluent , more engaging , more graceful than currently they seem to be .
Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise .
And maybe they need to be able to make mistakes and correct them , because in the end we are human .
Thank you .
Sheryl Sandberg admits she was terrified to step onto the TED stage in 2010 -- because she was going to talk , for the first time , about the lonely experience of being a woman in the top tiers of business . Millions of views later , the Facebook COO talks with the woman who pushed her to give that first talk , Pat Mitchell . Sandberg opens up about the reaction to her idea , and explores the ways that women still struggle with success .
Sheryl Sandberg : First time back . Nice to see everyone . It &apos;s always so nice to look out and see so many women .
PM : So when we first started talking about , maybe the subject wouldn &apos;t be social media , which we assumed it would be , but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions , particularly in the sector of technology and social media .
SS : So I was really scared to get on this stage and talk about women , because I grew up in the business world , as I think so many of us did .
They might notice . Or worse , if you say &quot; woman , &quot; people on the other end of the table think you &apos;re asking for special treatment , or complaining .
But I also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
Because year after year , I was one of fewer and fewer , and now , often the only woman in a room .
It will end your business career . You cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman . You &apos;ll never be taken seriously again .
And the answer to what would I do if I wasn &apos;t afraid is I would get on the TED stage , and talk about women , and leadership . And I did , and survived . PM : I would say , not only survived . I &apos;m thinking of that moment , Sheryl , when you and I were standing backstage together , and you turned to me , and you told me a story .
SS : Oh , yeah . PM : What was that story ?
And Pat &apos;s a friend , and so , not related to the speech I was planning on giving , which was chock full of facts and figures , and nothing personal , I told Pat the story . I said , well , I &apos;m having a hard day .
And you looked at me and said , you have to tell that story .
I &apos;m going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg ?
And I did . And I think that &apos;s a really important part of the journey .
My husband read it and he was like , this is like eating your Wheaties . No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there &apos;s someone -- no one , no one will read this book .
Felling like I didn &apos;t belong there , feeling guilty to this day .
PM : I think that one of the most striking parts about the book , and in my opinion , one of the reasons it &apos;s hit such a nerve and is resonating around the world , is that you are personal in the book , and that you do make it clear that , while you &apos;ve observed some things that are very important for other women to know , that you &apos;ve had the same challenges that many others of us have , as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and possibly the people who don &apos;t believe the same .
SS : After I did the TED Talk , what happened was -- you know , I never really expected to write a book , I &apos;m not an author , I &apos;m not a writer , and it was viewed a lot , and it really started impacting people &apos;s lives .
And so she watched this TED Talk , and she went back the next day , she took the job , she went home , and she handed her husband the grocery list . And she said , I can do this .
There was a doctor I met who was an attending physician at Johns Hopkins , and he said that until he saw my TED Talk , it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in his med school classes were women , they weren &apos;t speaking as much as the men as he did his rounds .
So he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more , and it still didn &apos;t work .
So he could call evenly on men and women . And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better , and he was able to go back to them and tell them that .
And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice .
PM : And in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you &apos;ve learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons .
So what did that feel like , and become like in your life ?
SS : I mean , I &apos;m grateful , I &apos;m honored , I &apos;m happy , and it &apos;s the very beginning .
I have read every study , I have pored over the materials , and the lessons are very clear . Because here &apos;s what we know : What we know is that stereotypes are holding women back from leadership roles all over the world .
Even within our own country , to Japan , to Korea , to China , to Asia , Europe , they &apos;re so different . Except for one thing : gender .
Now we have , all over the world , women are called &quot; bossy . &quot; There is a word for &quot; bossy , &quot; for little girls , in every language there &apos;s one .
Now I know there aren &apos;t a lot of men here , but bear with me .
Please raise your hand if you &apos;ve been told you &apos;re too aggressive at work .
If you &apos;re a woman , please raise your hand if you &apos;ve ever been told you &apos;re too aggressive at work .
Now , do we think women are more aggressive than men ? Of course not .
And the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it .
He read the book . He stood on a stage with me , he invited me in front of his whole management team , men and women , and he said , I thought we were good at this . I thought I was good at this .
And I want you to know we &apos;re never going to do it again .
And so next time you all see someone call a little girl &quot; bossy , &quot; you walk right up to that person , big smile , and you say , &quot; That little girl &apos;s not bossy . That little girl has executive leadership skills . &quot; PM : I know that &apos;s what you &apos;re telling your daughter . SS : Absolutely .
I mean , let &apos;s just put it out there , face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors , and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions .
Have you seen changes ?
But what really matters to me , and I think all of us , is action .
And to them I say , I &apos;m not sorry at all . At all . I mean , the women should be paid as much as the men .
Everywhere I go , women say they &apos;re getting better relationships with their spouses , asking for more help at home , asking for the promotions they should be getting at work , and importantly , believing it themselves . Even little things .
The foundation I started along with the book &quot; Lean In &quot; helps women , or men , start circles -- small groups , it can be 10 , it can be however many you want , which meet once a month .
You know , 500 times roughly 10 .
PM : Wow , that &apos;s amazing .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
These women are 29 , they are told by their society that they are &quot; left over , &quot; because they are not yet married , and the process of coming together once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves .
I looked at them , we went around and introduced ourselves , and they all said their names and where they &apos;re from , and I said , I &apos;m Sheryl Sandberg , and this was my dream .
Right , which , I admit , I do . Right ? I &apos;ve talked about it before .
That &apos;s the kind of change we have to hope for .
Because I think when the book first came out , many people thought , well , this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up .
And yet the book is being read , as you say , in rural and developing countries .
SS : The book is about self-confidence , and about equality .
Everywhere in the world , we live in a world where the men get &quot; and , &quot; and women get &quot; or . &quot;
Men only .
We assume men can do it all , slash -- have jobs and children .
And I think people don &apos;t fully understand how broad the message is .
They &apos;re using &quot; Lean In &quot; to help people make the transition back to what would be a fair life , really rescuing them from their pimps , and using it .
And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia .
And it &apos;s part of what TEDWomen does .
PM : If you were invited now to make another TEDWomen talk , what would you say that is a result of this experience , for you personally , and what you &apos;ve learned about women , and men , as you &apos;ve made this journey ?
That it &apos;s not good enough , that it &apos;s not changing quickly enough .
And you know what we found ?
Seventy-seven cents to the dollar .
If you are a Latina , we &apos;re at 54 cents .
2002 .
And I think we are not really being honest about that , for so many reasons . It &apos;s so hard to talk about gender .
We have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back -- I think I would say in a louder voice , we need to get rid of the word &quot; bossy &quot; and bring back the word &quot; feminist , &quot; because we need it .
SS : A lot more leaning in .
Thanks for leaning in and saying yes .
Suzanne Talhouk : Don &apos;t kill your language
Good morning !
They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
I said , &quot; The menu , please . &quot;
&quot; I do . &quot;
Is the French pronunciation correct ?
He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
At that moment , I started thinking .
I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
How did we get here ?
Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
How ?
All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
They kept it close to them .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
So when we say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
How would you feel ?
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I asked her once how things were going .
The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; toqborni , &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
Does she want to commit suicide ?
It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you -- &quot; And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot;
So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
Even though many people told me , &quot; Why do you bother ?
No problem !
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot;
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; written on it .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
Photos of &quot; cool &quot; guys and girls .
And to whoever might say , &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot;
I will keep on saying &quot; Internet &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
Creativity is the idea .
At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
A single novel could make us global again .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
Second , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
A baby first identifies its father through language .
I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot;
Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe .
In the pitch-black night , stung by jellyfish , choking on salt water , singing to herself , hallucinating … Diana Nyad just kept on swimming . And that &apos;s how she finally achieved her lifetime goal as an athlete : an extreme 100-mile swim from Cuba to Florida -- at age 64 . Hear her story .
Not only have I tried four times , but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950 , and it &apos;s still never been done .
It &apos;s an expedition of some 30 people .
The shark experts are the best in the world -- large predators below .
The conditions themselves , besides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean -- the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself , the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth .
And I &apos;m thinking , what are they imagining ?
Yes , I have a team . And the team is expert , and the team is courageous , and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true with any major expedition on the planet .
And the debate has raged , hasn &apos;t it , since the Greeks , of isn &apos;t it what it &apos;s all about ?
And here we &apos;ve been on this journey , and the truth is , it &apos;s been thrilling .
When I turned 60 , the dream was still alive from having tried this in my 20s , and dreamed it and imagined it .
And it was deep . It was deep in my soul .
That &apos;s always there and it &apos;s undeniable .
Let &apos;s face it , we &apos;re all on a one-way street , aren &apos;t we , and what are we going to do ?
And all this past year in training , I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it , floating around in my brain , and it says , &quot; You go ahead , you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic , you be the observer , while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again , but yet isn &apos;t afraid and isn &apos;t timid and lives life in a bold way . &quot;
It is the goal , and I should be so shallow to say that this year , the destination was even sweeter than the journey .
And at this point , by this summer , everybody -- scientists , sports scientists , endurance experts , neurologists , my own team , Bonnie -- said it &apos;s impossible .
And now we &apos;re there .
You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you , as we all do .
And we started , and for the next 53 hours , it was an intense , unforgettable life experience .
I have a playlist of about 85 songs , and especially in the middle of the night , and that night , because we use no lights -- lights attract jellyfish , lights attract sharks , lights attract baitfish that attract sharks , so we go in the pitch black of the night .
You can &apos;t see the front of your hand , Bonnie and my team on the boat , they just hear the slapping of the arms , and they know where I am , because there &apos;s no visual at all .
I &apos;ve got a tight rubber cap , so I don &apos;t hear a thing .
Now there &apos;s a talent unto itself .
Imagine there &apos;s no heaven And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon &apos;s &quot; Imagine , &quot; I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes , exactly .
And the vomiting starts , the seawater , you &apos;re not well , you &apos;re wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection .
It &apos;s causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth , but the tentacles can &apos;t get you .
The water &apos;s 85 degrees , and yet you &apos;re losing weight and using calories , and as you come over toward the side of the boat , not allowed to touch it , not allowed to get out , but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I &apos;m doing , am I all right , I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here .
It &apos;s gorgeous .
It &apos;s just -- So , uh , wooo . And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I &apos;m never told , really , how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
What &apos;s going to happen to the weather and the currents and , God forbid , you &apos;re stung when you don &apos;t think you could be stung in all this armor , and Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering and I was hanging on by a thread and she said , &quot; Come here , &quot; and I came close to the boat , and she said , &quot; Look , look out there , &quot; and I saw light , because the day &apos;s easier than the night , and I thought we were coming into day , and I saw a stream of white light along the horizon , and I said , &quot; It &apos;s going to be morning soon . &quot;
It was 15 more hours , which for most swimmers would be a long time .
So here we go , and I somehow , without a decision , went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe , I just went into thinking about this dream , and why , and how .
That &apos;s the everyday machinations .
But I decided to think , as I went along , about , the phrase usually is reaching for the stars , and in my case , it &apos;s reaching for the horizon .
What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons .
The epic journey is going to be over .
That little tracker that was on the computer ?
Well , they were just there for 53 hours , and I was there for years .
But the point is , and the point was that every day of our lives is epic , and I &apos;ll tell you , when I walked up onto that beach , staggered up onto that beach , and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way , rehearsed what I would say on the beach .
Another 12 , 24 hours in the saltwater , the whole thing -- and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment , that I heard the word tracheotomy .
If she can &apos;t talk when she gets to the shore , she &apos;s gonna be pissed off . &quot;
It was a very real moment , with that crowd , with my team .
And we &apos;ll never forget it . It &apos;ll always be part of us .
I live it . What &apos;s the phrase from today from Socrates ?
So I don &apos;t stand up and say , don &apos;t ever give up .
The second is , &quot; You can chase your dreams at any age ; you &apos;re never too old . &quot;
Yeah .
And the third thing I said on that beach was , &quot; It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world , and in other ways , and the most important ways , it &apos;s a team , and if you think I &apos;m a badass , you want to meet Bonnie . &quot;
Where are you ?
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes , when you achieve your dreams , it &apos;s not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them .
In the three months since that swim ended , I &apos;ve sat down with Oprah and I &apos;ve been in President Obama &apos;s Oval Office .
I &apos;ve signed a wonderful major book contract .
I &apos;m proud of it all , but the truth is , I &apos;m walking around tall because I am that bold , fearless person , and I will be , every day , until it &apos;s time for these days to be done .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Find a way !
&quot; In the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us . &quot; Boyd Varty , a wildlife activist , shares stories of animals , humans and their interrelatedness , or &quot; ubuntu &quot; -- defined as , &quot; I am , because of you . &quot; And he dedicates the talk to South African leader Nelson Mandela , the human embodiment of that same great-hearted , generous spirit .
Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom .
I grew up in wonder .
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve .
Now for as long as I can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so I think it &apos;s a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
Now my stories are not the stories that you &apos;ll hear on the news , and while it &apos;s true that Africa is a harsh place , I also know it to be a place where people , animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world .
He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration , and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status .
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy .
At night , I would sit with my family around the snowy , bunny-eared TV , and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly .
Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
Ubuntu : I am because of you .
It &apos;s not a new idea or value but it &apos;s one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on .
Ubuntu is at play right now .
Without you , I &apos;m just a guy talking to an empty room , and I spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it &apos;s not the same as this .
Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique .
Solly grew up tending to his father &apos;s cattle .
The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks .
He then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
He fixed roads , he mended wetlands , he did some anti-poaching .
And it was an old track , but for fun he turned and he began to follow it , and I tell you , I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker .
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , &quot; Solly , you are pathologically helpful . &quot;
We worked together as a team .
So we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly &apos;s wife , who was learning English , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , &quot; Hello , I love you .
Now on the day that Solly saved my life , he was already my hero .
Because of the heat , I took my shoes off , and I rolled up my pants , and I walked into the water .
The water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way upstream .
And if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , &quot; Don &apos;t go in there . Don &apos;t go in there . &quot; And of course , the crocodile was in the shadows .
Wham ! It hits me by my right leg .
It &apos;s shaking me violently .
Solly on the bank sees that I &apos;m in trouble .
The croc again continues to shake me .
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream .
My foot goes down its throat . It spits me out .
My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
The meat is torn up .
As I come out of the water , Solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
He comes straight into the channel .
He gets to me . He grabs me .
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
He turns . He walks me up the bank .
He wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
Now — Now I don &apos;t know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you , but for Solly , it was as natural as breathing .
In a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
Joy is shared . Achievement is shared .
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share , and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value , his animated , empathetic action in every moment .
And then I met this young lady .
In fact , Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance .
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route .
And yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
It looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals .
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
And I watched as the matriarch drank , and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants , looks like the arm in motion , and she began to make her way up the steep bank .
And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill .
She attempted it a second time , and again , halfway up , she fell backwards .
Halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu , and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us .
If Africa has a gift to share , it &apos;s a gift of a more collective society .
Thank you .
But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session .
I &apos;m so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
And so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
And she was like , &quot; Well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot;
He was the father of our nation and we &apos;ve got a road to walk in South Africa .
You know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
But I think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
PM : And that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . BV : Oh , thank you .
Dambisa Moyo : Is China the new idol for emerging economies ?
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death . &quot;
At the time , these words were earmarked and targeted against the British , but over the last 200 years , they &apos;ve come to embody what many Westerners believe , that freedom is the most cherished value , and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them .
Over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development .
Meanwhile , American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions , motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets .
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched . &quot;
However , to many who live in the emerging markets , this is an illusion , and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was signed in 1948 , was unanimously adopted , what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries , and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights .
Today , many people who live in the emerging markets , where 90 percent of the world &apos;s population lives , believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point , and what is actually important is delivering on food , shelter , education and healthcare .
Now , I know many people in this room and around the world will think , &quot; Well actually , this is hard to grasp , &quot; because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct .
What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote ?
I &apos;ve met with presidents , dissidents , policymakers , lawyers , teachers , doctors and the man on the street , and through these conversations , it &apos;s become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there &apos;s actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world .
I &apos;m not saying people in the emerging markets don &apos;t understand democracy , nor am I saying that they wouldn &apos;t ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders .
However , I am saying that on balance , they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from , and how it is their governments can deliver for them , than whether or not the government was elected by democracy .
And rather than have private capitalism , they have state capitalism .
And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
If you will indulge me , I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they &apos;ve come to this belief .
She &apos;s been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence .
We see that in China , 28 percent of people had secondary school access .
So in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
Today , the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world .
However , these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient , which is a measure of income equality .
Thirdly , people in the emerging markets look at China &apos;s amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout .
Now this is something that people can see and point to .
Finally , China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces .
However , through a network of state-owned enterprises , the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas , using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions .
I want to be able to do what China &apos;s doing .
I &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance .
In fact , countries like Taiwan , Singapore , Chile , not just China , have shown that actually , it &apos;s economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy .
The study found that if your per capita income is about 1,000 dollars a year , your democracy will last about eight and a half years .
And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water .
But perhaps it &apos;s also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy , because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies , democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
But also , we &apos;re finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years .
But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen .
Well , the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism ; greater protectionisms of nation-states ; but also , as I just pointed out a moment ago , ever-declining political rights and individual rights .
And I suggest that they have two options .
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model , and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy , this is basically going against headwinds , but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy , and state capitalism .
The other option is for the West to cooperate , and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them .
that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential , they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want .
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior , the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one .
Indeed , the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States .
In fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
It &apos;s the model that put food on the table .
It put a man on the moon .
Today , generations are looking at China and saying , &quot; China can produce infrastructure , China can produce economic growth , and we like that . &quot;
People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way , to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time .
Just to illustrate , I went into my annals of myself .
Awww . I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969 .
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government .
In this vein , we can increase economic growth .
But also , it &apos;s going to require that we look at our assumptions , assumptions and strictures that we &apos;ve grown up with around democracy , around private capitalism , around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms .
Ultimately , it &apos;s about transforming the world and making it a better place .
Abha Dawesar : Life in the &quot; digital now &quot;
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy , and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me .
Now , Maui was terrified of the dark , so I had to carry him up the stairs , actually down the stairs first , for his walk , and then bring him back up .
And through all of this , I had to hold a torch between my teeth .
For a shower , I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym .
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices .
I wasn &apos;t the only one .
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology , and yet here we were , obsessed about being wired .
The self as we once knew it no longer exists , and I think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and I want to talk to you about what I think that means .
They &apos;re both stories , interpretations .
We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless .
Our story of our life is based on direct experience , but it &apos;s embellished .
It needs months and years .
But the story is not about these chapters .
It &apos;s not only about the heartbreak and the happiness , the victories and the disappointments , but it &apos;s because how because of these , and sometimes , more importantly , in spite of these , we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves .
Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment , but the one that narrates needs several moments , a whole sequence of them , and that &apos;s why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time .
Without it , we would have no music .
I think that technology has altered that flow of time .
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
Science can do things with and in a picosecond , but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second .
We need time &apos;s arrow to understand cause and effect , not just in the material world , but in our own intentions and our motivations .
What happens when time warps ?
This is because time doesn &apos;t flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
Far away over there is now here .
And that &apos;s not all .
With no distinction left between the past , the present and the future , and the here or there , we are left with this moment everywhere , this moment that I &apos;ll call the digital now .
This digital now is not the present , because it &apos;s always a few seconds ahead , with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones .
This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state .
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else .
Why not buy his book ? Tweet it . Share it .
Find other people reading those books .
Choice is freedom , but not when it &apos;s constantly for its own sake .
Not just are we absent from it , but so is everyone else .
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night , shop for Parisian macarons , and leave video messages that get picked up later .
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter .
There are those who went back to their lives , and those who are still displaced after so many months .
For example , it &apos;s said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets .
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous .
We might think that those younger than us , those who are born into this , will adapt more naturally .
I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me .
If I were a child today , I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks , but it really wouldn &apos;t be the same , because much later , I went to Vienna , and I went to the Spanish riding school , and I could feel my grandfather right beside me .
And even here , when I look at the Great Bear , I get back that feeling of being a child , hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder , and I can get back that feeling of being a child again .
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core , because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget , even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable .
They &apos;re like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
It cannot be stored .
It might have happened while we were playing an instrument , or looking into the eyes of someone we &apos;ve known for a very long time .
The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one .
The present joins a flow of time from before and after .
I wanted to learn to skip , and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it .
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take , that time can &apos;t be fought , and because it will pass and it will move , we owe the present moment our full attention .
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention , and definitely from my grandmother , love and attention were one and the same thing .
It threatens the flow of love .
We can choose otherwise .
We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time .
Thank you .
Why do we turn to nonprofits , NGOs and governments to solve society &apos;s biggest problems ? Michael Porter admits he &apos;s biased , as a business school professor , but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water . Why ? Because when business solves a problem , it makes a profit -- which lets that solution grow .
We &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
Poor nutrition , access to water , climate change , deforestation , lack of skills , insecurity , not enough food , not enough healthcare , pollution .
We &apos;re all very aware .
That &apos;s the question I &apos;ve been struggling with , coming from my very different perspective .
I &apos;m a guy that works with business , helps business make money .
So why are we having so many problems with these social problems , and really is there any role for business , and if so , what is that role ?
Now , I think many have seen business as the problem , or at least one of the problems , in many of the social challenges we face .
You know , this is a low point in the respect for business .
It &apos;s seen as the problem now , for most people .
There &apos;s a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing , that actually have made the problem worse .
How have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems , these many issues that we face in society ?
Indeed , the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations .
Enormous innovation , enormous energy , enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges .
I &apos;m a business school professor , but I &apos;ve actually founded , I think , now , four nonprofits .
That was the way we &apos;ve thought about how to deal with these issues .
But I think at this moment , we &apos;ve been at this for quite a while .
We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities , and there &apos;s an awkward reality .
We &apos;re not winning .
We &apos;re making incremental progress .
If we cut all the complexity away , we have the problem of scale .
We can make progress . We can show benefits .
We &apos;re helping . We &apos;re doing better . We &apos;re doing good .
We can &apos;t make a large-scale impact on these problems .
Because we don &apos;t have the resources .
And that &apos;s clearer now than it &apos;s been for decades .
There &apos;s not enough tax revenue , there &apos;s not enough philanthropic donations , to deal with these problems the way we &apos;re dealing with them now .
And the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
How are those resources really created , the resources we &apos;re going to need to deal with all these societal challenges ?
All wealth is actually created by business .
That &apos;s how all wealth is created .
That &apos;s where all the resources come from .
Other institutions can utilize them to do important work , but only business can create them .
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
How do we tap into this ?
That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they &apos;re trying to solve .
Why ? Because that profit allows whatever solution we &apos;ve created to be infinitely scalable .
The solution becomes self-sustaining .
Now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
Business should give more .
And that &apos;s been the path that we &apos;ve been on in business .
Now , I started out as a strategy professor , and I &apos;m still a strategy professor .
But I &apos;ve also , over the years , worked more and more on social issues .
The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually , there &apos;s a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance .
The classic example is pollution .
Reducing pollution is expensive , therefore businesses don &apos;t want to do it .
It &apos;s too expensive to have a safe working environment , therefore business makes more money if they don &apos;t have a safe working environment .
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom .
They resisted workplace improvement .
But the more deeply I got into all these social issues , one after another , and actually , the more I tried to address them myself , personally , in a few cases , through nonprofits that I was involved with , the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite .
That &apos;s a very simplistic view .
That &apos;s where the real profit comes .
We &apos;ve learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit .
It makes the business more productive and efficient .
Having a safer working environment actually , and avoiding accidents , it makes the business more profitable , because it &apos;s a sign of good processes .
Issue by issue by issue , we start to learn that actually there &apos;s no trade-off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense .
I mean , what we &apos;ve found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure , because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent .
In the very short run , you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there &apos;s fundamentally opposing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we &apos;re learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
Imagine if we could do that , because if we could do it , we could scale .
And guess what ? That &apos;s happening now , finally , partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade .
This is an example of Jain Irrigation .
We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria that &apos;s figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
There &apos;s a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems , and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business .
This is what I call shared value : addressing a social issue with a business model .
Shared value is capitalism , but it &apos;s a higher kind of capitalism .
Shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously .
We can address shared value at multiple levels .
But in order to get this solution working , we have to now change how business sees itself , and this is thankfully underway .
We &apos;re now seeing companies embrace this idea .
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships , that have found these ways to collaborate .
And government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way .
I know it . I &apos;m seeing it .
Young people , I think , my Harvard Business School students , are getting it .
Thank you .
What does real scientific work look like ? As neuroscientist Stuart Firestein jokes : It looks a lot less like the scientific method and a lot more like &quot; farting around … in the dark . &quot; In this witty talk , Firestein gets to the heart of science as it is really practiced and suggests that we should value what we don &apos;t know -- or &quot; high-quality ignorance &quot; -- just as much as what we know .
I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works -- bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
Science , we generally are told , is a very well-ordered mechanism for understanding the world , for gaining facts , for gaining data , that it &apos;s rule-based , that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we &apos;ve been doing this for 14 generations or so now , and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard , cold facts out of the data .
So there &apos;s the scientific method , but what &apos;s really going on is this . &#91; The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around &#93; And it &apos;s going on kind of like that .
So this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at Columbia University , where I &apos;m both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works .
But at the same time , it &apos;s my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain , and that &apos;s a big subject , and it takes quite a while to organize that , and it &apos;s quite challenging and it &apos;s quite interesting , but I have to say , it &apos;s not so exhilarating .
Well , the course I was and am teaching is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. It &apos;s 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts , it uses this giant book called &quot; Principles of Neural Science &quot; by three famous neuroscientists .
Just to put that in some perspective , that &apos;s the weight of two normal human brains .
That &apos;s clearly not true .
And that &apos;s not really the case either .
We talk about what we don &apos;t know .
Indeed , this was , I think , best said by Marie Curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done .
I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie , because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect . That &apos;s the real thing .
Nonetheless , this is what I think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists , the what-remains-to-be-done .
It is , if you will , the ignorance .
So I thought , well , maybe I should teach a course on ignorance , something I can finally excel at , perhaps , for example .
You can find all sorts of information there . It &apos;s wide open .
Now I use this word &quot; ignorance , &quot; of course , to be at least in part intentionally provocative , because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and I clearly don &apos;t mean any of those .
The ignorant are clearly unenlightened , unaware , uninformed , and present company today excepted , often occupy elected offices , it seems to me .
I mean a different kind of ignorance .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful idea : thoroughly conscious ignorance .
So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate .
How can you ever know all of this ?
In 2006 , there were 1.3 million papers published .
Divide that by the number of minutes in a year , and you wind up with three new papers per minute .
I have to get out of here actually . I have to go read .
We just don &apos;t worry about it , in a way .
But knowing a lot of stuff doesn &apos;t make you a scientist .
But in science , knowing a lot of stuff is not the point .
So knowledge is a big subject , but I would say ignorance is a bigger one .
So one of them , a popular one , is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme or another .
We don &apos;t have any such guarantee .
So I think the puzzle model doesn &apos;t work .
So peel by peel , you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth .
Another one , a kind of popular one , is the iceberg idea , that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden .
We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is , or we could just wait for it to melt , I suppose , these days , but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg . Right ?
I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well , where no matter how many buckets you take out , there &apos;s always another bucket of water to be had , or my particularly favorite one , with the effect and everything , the ripples on a pond .
So the knowledge generates ignorance .
This is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein &apos;s work , in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers . &#91; &quot; Science is always wrong . It never solves a problem without creating 10 more . &quot; &#93; I find that kind of glorious , and I think he &apos;s precisely right , plus it &apos;s a kind of job security .
I love that term , &quot; question propagation , &quot; this idea of questions propagating out there .
It &apos;s rather kind of the other way around , really .
What are we using this collection of facts for ?
Because , you know , there &apos;s low-quality ignorance and there &apos;s high-quality ignorance . It &apos;s not all the same .
Sometimes we call them bull sessions .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s what the argument is about .
It &apos;s what makes a good question .
I &apos;m going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments .
So what you know , you can know anywhere from nothing to everything , of course , and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot .
Doesn &apos;t know much but they have a lot of interest .
Now you look at a master &apos;s student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it &apos;s been narrowed somewhat .
That &apos;s where you find people like me , I &apos;m afraid .
This whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x-axis .
So yes , you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist , but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff . That just makes you a geek , right ?
Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions .
Because it &apos;s not always quite so straightforward .
Well , one thing the brain does , it moves us around .
That seems kind of simple , somehow or another .
So that maybe is not that interesting .
How about the visual system ?
I mean , we love our visual systems . We do all kinds of cool stuff .
But now here &apos;s the thing : Our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does .
They work differently than our visual systems in some cases , but nonetheless we &apos;ve been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system .
A hundred years of robotics , and we can &apos;t get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other .
Turn around , and they fall over . It &apos;s a serious problem .
What ought we to be studying ?
I &apos;ll give you an example from my own lab , my own particularly smelly question , since we work on the sense of smell .
These are just plain old molecules , but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face , you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose .
How do we turn molecules into perceptions ?
Here &apos;s another example : two very simple molecules , again in this kind of chemical notation .
Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it , and yet one of them , heptyl acetate , has the distinct odor of a pear , and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana .
One is , how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that &apos;s so clear as a pear or a banana ?
I mean , that &apos;s remarkable to me , clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet .
So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions .
And I also think it &apos;s important to realize that the conversation &apos;s been going on for a while , by the way .
And it &apos;s this abiding by ignorance that I think we have to learn how to do .
I guess it comes down to our education system , so I &apos;m going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education , because I think that &apos;s where it really has to play out .
We just can &apos;t sell facts for a living anymore .
So what do we have to do ? We have to give our students a taste for the boundaries , for what &apos;s outside that circumference , for what &apos;s outside the facts , what &apos;s just beyond the facts .
Well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
So in second grade , all the kids are interested in science , They like to take stuff apart . They have great curiosity .
They like to play around . They &apos;re in second grade .
But by 11th or 12th grade , fewer than 10 percent of them have any interest in science whatsoever , let alone a desire to go into science as a career .
Is this what we want ?
You know . You can imagine what it is .
This can &apos;t possibly continue to go on .
Geneticists always say , you always get what you screen for .
So we always will get what we screen for , and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods .
Evaluation is one thing . You hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days , in the educational literature , but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error .
That &apos;s different than weeding , and usually , I have to tell you , when people talk about evaluation , evaluating students , evaluating teachers , evaluating schools , evaluating programs , that they &apos;re really talking about weeding .
So I &apos;d say what we need is a test that says , &quot; What is x ? &quot;
Or , &quot; You know what , I &apos;ll look it up , I &apos;ll ask someone , I &apos;ll phone someone . I &apos;ll find out . &quot;
And maybe for the advanced placement classes , it could be , &quot; Here &apos;s the answer . What &apos;s the next question ? &quot;
So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats , who said &quot; Education is not about filling buckets ; So I &apos;d say , let &apos;s get out the matches .
Thank you .
Can we edit the content of our memories ? It &apos;s a sci-fi-tinged question that Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu are asking in their lab at MIT . Essentially , the pair shoot a laser beam into the brain of a living mouse to activate and manipulate its memory . In this unexpectedly amusing talk they share not only how , but -- more importantly -- why they do this .
I had just gone through a breakup .
Now , as it turns out , I &apos;m a neuroscientist , so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful , emotional undertones that color in that memory , are largely mediated by separate brain systems .
Then I realized , maybe that &apos;s a little bit lofty for now .
Could we jump-start that memory back to life , maybe even play with the contents of that memory ?
So there is a catch . There is a catch .
But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab .
As neuroscientists , we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works .
To do this , there &apos;s only two simple steps to follow .
As simple as that .
So , turns out finding a memory in the brain isn &apos;t all that easy .
But memory is not .
So yeah , this task does seem to be daunting .
It turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory , and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory .
If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now , you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory .
XL : When you zoom in into the hippocampus , of course you will see lots of cells , but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory , because whenever a cell is active , like when it &apos;s forming a memory , it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active .
They &apos;re sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active .
So whenever a memory is being formed , any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed .
The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells , but the green brain cells , the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory .
You &apos;re actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now .
It shouldn &apos;t take minutes or hours to work .
SR : So what do you think , Xu ?
XL : Nah . Drugs are pretty messy . They spread everywhere .
So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time .
SR : So electricity is pretty fast , but we probably wouldn &apos;t be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory , and we &apos;d probably fry the brain .
SR : So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light .
SR : -- and because normally brain cells don &apos;t respond to pulses of light , so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light-sensitive switch .
XL : Yep . You heard it right .
SR : And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics .
You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light-sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it , and in this case we click it on with pulses of light .
So whenever a memory is being formed , any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light-sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see .
What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here , and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box .
Now with our system , the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory , only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin .
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected .
So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box , and when we put them back into the same box , it will basically show freezing because it doesn &apos;t want to be detected by any potential threats in this box .
Do I shake their hand ? Do I turn around and run away ?
Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you , that temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look .
But what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time , we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before ?
SR : All right , and here &apos;s the million-dollar experiment .
Now Xu and I , on the other hand , were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen .
XL : And this is what we saw .
They want to know , what &apos;s going on in this new box ?
But the moment we turned on the laser , like you see now , all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode .
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
While watching this , Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself .
After a kind of long , awkward period of time , Steve broke the silence .
XL : &quot; Yes , &quot; I said . &quot; Indeed it worked ! &quot;
And then we published our findings in the journal Nature .
Maybe we can take a look at some of those .
Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote , because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman &apos;s voice , it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I &apos;ve heard come our way .
&#91; &quot; This scares the hell out of me ... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years ? ! OH MY GOD WE &apos;RE DOOMED &quot; &#93; XL : Indeed , if we take a look at the second one , I think we can all agree that it &apos;s , meh , probably not as positive .
SR : Now , in the spirit of the third quote , we want to tell you about a recent project that we &apos;ve been working on in lab that we &apos;ve called Project Inception .
Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory ?
So far what we &apos;ve told you is basically we can control this &quot; play &quot; button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time , anywhere .
Yes we can .
It &apos;s sort of like making a remix tape .
Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain , we can start by taking our animals , and let &apos;s say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before .
We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box .
So here we &apos;re trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves .
So to test if we had done so , we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box .
It &apos;s as though it &apos;s recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened .
XL : So , so far we are only talking about this light-controlled &quot; on &quot; switch .
So everything we &apos;ve been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind , with its seemingly mysterious properties , is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with .
I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
XL : Nowadays , people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories , whether that &apos;s old or new , positive or negative , all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works .
That &apos;s exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes .
XL : Indeed , we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn &apos;t have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination .
How do we push this technology forward ?
So let &apos;s think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here , because Xu and I think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us .
Peter Attia : Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
I &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot .
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
The question that was being asked of me was a different one , which was , did she also need an amputation ?
In her case , I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life .
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable . I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee .
But more importantly , see , I passed no judgment on her , because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself .
You see , unlike the woman the night before , this woman had type 2 diabetes .
And we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
As I looked down at her in the bed , I thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to amputate your foot .
I &apos;d like to say I don &apos;t know .
You see , in the hubris of my youth , I thought I had her all figured out .
She got diabetes . Case closed .
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma , I never once questioned the conventional wisdom .
Three years later , I found out how wrong I was .
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I &apos;d gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome .
I had become insulin-resistant .
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
And insulin resistance , as its name suggests , is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job .
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise , and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease , cancer , even Alzheimer &apos;s disease , and amputations , just like that woman a few years earlier .
I did this and lost 40 pounds , weirdly while exercising less .
More importantly , I don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me , was it possible it was failing someone else ?
Now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
You treat the obesity .
What if obesity isn &apos;t the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
I know it sounds crazy because we &apos;re obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic , but hear me out .
I &apos;m not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
When we become insulin-resistant , the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state .
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells , it &apos;s probably the safest place to store it .
This is a really subtle distinction , but the implication could be profound .
Sure , the bruise hurts like hell , and you almost certainly don &apos;t like the discolored look , but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem .
Now , imagine we thought bruises were the problem , and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises : masking creams , painkillers , you name it , all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables .
Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
Cause and effect .
Maybe we should be asking ourselves , is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity , at least in most people ?
Let &apos;s look at some suggestive facts .
And by the way , they don &apos;t appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people .
Now I don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy .
So what if we &apos;re fighting the wrong war , fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance ?
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong ?
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but I &apos;m wide open to others .
If you ask yourself , what &apos;s a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant , the answer probably isn &apos;t too much food .
Now , we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run , and there &apos;s even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly .
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago , I did it simply by restricting those things , which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience .
But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity , diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested .
Today , I devote all of my time to working on this problem , and I &apos;ll go wherever the science takes me .
I &apos;ve been humbled enough by all I don &apos;t know .
We &apos;ve recruited a team of scientific rivals , the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what &apos;s at the heart of this epidemic .
Others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
But this team of multi-disciplinary , highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things .
And two , if we &apos;re willing to be wrong , if we &apos;re willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer , we can solve this problem .
Briefly , to address this , our research program is focused around three meta-themes , or questions .
Second , based on these insights , can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that &apos;s safe and practical to implement ?
Just because you know what to do doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re always going to do it .
I don &apos;t know how this journey is going to end , but this much seems clear to me , at least : We can &apos;t keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did .
I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance , because as medical professionals , we &apos;ve shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals : open minds , the courage to throw out yesterday &apos;s ideas when they don &apos;t appear to be working , and the understanding that scientific truth isn &apos;t final , but constantly evolving .
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
seven years ago .
I &apos;d like to tell her how sorry I am .
You didn &apos;t need my judgment and my contempt .
Maybe the system , of which I was a part , was letting you down .
Paul Pholeros : How to reduce poverty ? Fix homes
The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal .
What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars use the words , it all just sounds so , so simple .
I &apos;ll leave that to others .
Housing For Health works with poor people .
Over the last 28 years , this tough , grinding , dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia , and more recently overseas , and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments .
I &apos;m going to start where the story began , 1985 , in central Australia .
Eighty percent of what walked in the door , in terms of illness , was infectious disease -- third world , developing world infectious disease , caused by a poor living environment .
He got a medical doctor .
And he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project .
Always a good start , no money .
And I want you to start on a project which in his language he called &quot; uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku , &quot; which , translated , is &quot; a plan to stop people getting sick , &quot; a profound brief .
First step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we aiming at .
&#91; Washing , clothes , wastewater , nutrition ... &#93; Now , I was very , very unimpressed .
Big ideas need big words and preferably a lot of them .
What I didn &apos;t see and what you can &apos;t see is that he &apos;d assembled thousands of pages of local , national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets .
The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate , so the story had to be told in pictures of what were these goals .
So we had the goals , and each one of these goals -- and I won &apos;t go through them all — puts at the center the person and their health issue , and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good .
Now I hope most of you are thinking , &quot; What ? That sounds simple . &quot;
This morning before you came , who could have had a wash using a shower ?
I think it &apos;s fair to say , most people here could have had a shower this morning .
I want you all to select one of the houses of the 25 houses you see on the screen .
Have you all got a house ? I &apos;m going to ask you to live there for a few months , so make sure you &apos;ve got it right .
Okay . Let &apos;s see if your shower in that house is working .
If you get a green tick , your shower &apos;s working .
If you get a red cross , well , I &apos;ve looked carefully around the room and it &apos;s not going to make much difference to this crew .
And I know that &apos;s going to come as a shock to some of you , but you are .
We &apos;re really concerned with kids naught to five .
They leave a lifelong remnant .
You can &apos;t hear as well for the rest of your life .
And even skin infection , which we originally thought wasn &apos;t that big a problem , mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure , needing dialysis at age 40 .
Those ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses we &apos;ve looked at nationally around Australia , the same proportion .
Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems , and 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet .
Not well designed , not beautiful , not elegant -- just that they function .
Housing for Health projects aren &apos;t about measuring failure .
We start on day one of every project -- we &apos;ve learned , we don &apos;t make promises , we don &apos;t do reports .
By the evening of the first day , a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning .
That &apos;s our average budget .
It &apos;s very easy to spend money .
And these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars .
Thank you . The teams do a great job , and that &apos;s their work .
Why are the houses in such poor condition ?
Things wear out .
Simply not done , the house doesn &apos;t work .
They don &apos;t work . We have to fix them .
It &apos;s one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence , which I &apos;ve never seen evidence for , that &apos;s always ruled out as that &apos;s the problem with indigenous housing .
We argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem .
The people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution .
They do all aspects of the work .
Our work &apos;s always had a focus on health . That &apos;s the key .
It &apos;s a developing world illness , and yet , the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage .
Well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
We put washing facilities in the school as well , so kids can wash their faces many times during the day .
Second , the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick . So what do we do ?
He was loaned to us by a mining company .
So we used dirt to stop dust .
We tested and we reduced the dust .
So how do we do that ?
As our Aboriginal mate said , &quot; You white fellows ought to get out more . &quot;
He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide .
When the bug was in the gut , he &apos;d send back by return post some dung beetles .
And over the year , trachoma dropped radically in this place , and stayed low .
And finally , you get a good eye .
The New South Wales Department of Health , that radical organization , did an independent trial over three years to look at 10 years of the work we &apos;ve been doing in these sorts of projects in New South Wales , and they found a 40-percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment .
Just to show that the principles we &apos;ve used in Australia can be used in other places , I &apos;m just going to go to one other place , and that &apos;s Nepal , and what a beautiful place to go .
Health was poor .
It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch , invited by the family into their main room of the house .
People were cooking on their only fuel source , green timber .
Later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure .
We were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground . That &apos;s fine .
How do we actually get the smoke down ? So two problems , and design should be about more than one thing .
The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day -- clean , smokeless and free for the family .
And the answer from the Nepali team who is working at the minute would say , don &apos;t be ridiculous , we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim .
But as we all sit here today , there are now over 100 toilets built in this village and a couple nearby .
Yami Lama , he &apos;s a young boy .
Kanji Maya , she &apos;s a mother and a proud one .
Her lungs have got better , and they &apos;ll get better as time increases , because she &apos;s not cooking in the same smoke .
He &apos;s trebled his crop income , more food for the family and more money for the family .
And that , to me , is the key .
We &apos;ve never found that .
None of those are limited by geography , by skin color or by religion . None of them .
Nelson Mandela said , in the mid-2000s , not too far from here , he said that like slavery and Apartheid , &quot; Poverty is not natural .
I want to end by saying it &apos;s been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing , I think , extraordinary work , that have actually improved health , and , maybe only in a small way , reduced poverty .
